## Think about your life

Do you have enough time to think about your life and the meaning?

## Meaning and Purpose of Life

### What is the meaning of your life?

Having a meaning in life is one of the most fundamental human needs. However, for most people, finding their meaning in life is not obvious. Modern life has a way of distracting people from their true goals and many people find it hard to define the meaning in life. Especially at younger ages, people are searching for meaning in life, but this has been found to be unrelated to actually finding meaning (*Schippers and Ziegler, 2019*).

Viktor Frankl, an Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist who had survived the holocaust, used his experience to formulate a theory on the meaning of life. He concluded that life can have meaning even in the most impoverished circumstances (*Frankl, 2014*).

### What is the purpose of your life?

People with a purpose in life are less likely to experience conflict when making health-related decisions and are more likely to self-regulate when making these decisions and consequently experience better (mental) health outcomes (*Kang et al., 2019*).

Having a purpose in life can aid in overcoming stress, depression, anxiety, and other psychological problems (*Kim et al., 2014; Freedland, 2019*).

Purpose in life has been related to a decrease in mortality across all ages (*Hill and Turiano, 2014*). It thus appears that many benefits may be gained by enhancing meaning and purpose in life.

The best day of your life is the one on which you decide your life is your own. No apologies or excuses. No one to lean on, rely on, or blame. The gift is yours -- it is an amazing journey -- and you alone are responsible for the quality of it. This is the day your life really begins (- *Bob Moawad*).

## Awareness for Future

Do you live your life with an awareness of the lives of people in the future or future generations?

*Nurra and Oyserman (2018)* showed that children that were guided to experience connection between their current and adult future self, worked more and attained better school grades than children guided to experience low connection.

Many modern people say no, but originally people were not short-sighted.

## Seven generation

In our every deliberation, we must consider the impact of our decisions on the next seven generations (*Fenton, 1998*).

## Fulfillment of life

A fulfilled life with no regrets and a sense of purpose.

No matter how many regrets you have or what kind of relationships you have, your life will be fulfilled if your role and message are passed on to future generations (*Taketoshi Ozawa, 2016*).

## What is future design?

If individuals, organizations and societies are all conscious of the future and understand the perspectives and positions of future generations, our daily life, economic activity and societies become less myopic and evolve to a better direction in the long run.
