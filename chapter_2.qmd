# Future design: Combination of three academic disciplines

## Three research areas

A field that combines three academic disciplines

![](figures/L2/L2_1.png){fig-align="center" width="300" height="250"}

-   Experimental Economics: What kind of interventions change behavioral habits and culture?

-   Environmental Economics: How can we encourage economic activity to be more friendly to nature and the environment?

-   Future Studies: How people, organizations, and society change by being conscious of the future?

-   Most countries in the world engage in competition and economic activities based on capitalism and market principles.

-   Economic activities that permanently pursue profits (Katsuto Iwai, 2009, 2014)

Scope of activities and distribution that future generations can achieve.

Inequality in industrial society: Various disparities and the importance of capital During just 300 years of industrial society Non-linear and explosive growth

### 15th-18th century

-   Transitional period from agricultural society to industrial society

-   Differentiation based on geographical conditions (Products, resources, and labor from A to B)

### 19th-20th century

-   Industrial society during the growth period

-   Differentiation by production process

-   Importance of organizational tangible capital (factory/machine/transportation network)

Industrial society during the growth period

### 21st century

-   Future post-industrial society (information age)

-   Differentiation based on meaning and significance

-   Processing information, creating your own story

Future post-industrial society (information age)

### Post-Industrial Society

How long this society will continue?

### Brainstorming

Homo Sapiens (modern humans) and Homo Neanderthal are two similar species. Homo Sapiens are surviving even in modern days, however Homo Neanderthal got extinct over the period of time. Although Homo Neanderthal are much stronger than Homo Sapiens, why they got extinct?

Below is the profile of Homo Neanderthal:
