# Population Growth and Well-Being

## World population is increasing steadily

\[世界人口は着実に増加している\]

The world population has been steadily growing over the past few decades. According to the United Nations, the world population reached 7.9 billion in 2021 and is expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050.

The rate of population growth has been declining since the 1960s, thanks to improvements in healthcare and access to education, as well as the availability of birth control. However, population growth remains a concern in many parts of the world, particularly in developing countries where access to family planning services is limited.

Population growth has a significant impact on a wide range of issues, including food security, access to healthcare, and environmental sustainability. Managing population growth and ensuring sustainable development is a key challenge for policymakers around the world.

## World population density

\[世界の人口密度\]

The population density of the world varies greatly from region to region, with some areas being densely populated and others being sparsely populated.

The average population density of the world is approximately 58 people per square kilometer. However, this number is heavily influenced by large, sparsely populated areas such as Siberia, the Sahara Desert, and the Amazon rain forest.

Some of the most densely populated countries in the world include Bangladesh, Singapore, and Monaco, with population densities of 1,110, 8,188, and 26,337 people per square kilometer, respectively.

Overall, population density is an important factor in a range of issues, from urban planning and transportation to resource allocation and environmental sustainability.

## One-Child -\> Two-Child -\> Three-Child policy of China

### One-Child Policy (1980-2015)

-   Goal: To curb rapid population growth, seen as a barrier to economic development.

The 1970s were a decade shaped by fears about overpopulation. As the world’s most populous country, China was never far from the debate. In 1979, China designed its one-child policy, which was rolled out nationally from 1980 to curb population growth by limiting couples to having just one child.

By this point, China’s fertility rate — the number of children per woman — had already fallen quickly in the early 1970s, as you can see in the chart.

While China’s one-child policy restricted many families, there were exceptions to the rule. Enforcement differed widely by province and between urban and rural areas. Many couples were allowed to have another baby if their first was a girl. Other couples paid a fine for having more than one. As a result, fertility rates never dropped close to one.

The one-child policy also led to a severe gender imbalance in the country. The traditional preference for male children led to large numbers of girls being abandoned or placed in orphanages, or cases of sex-selective abortions or even female infanticide.

"This poses problems for the marriage market, especially for men with less socioeconomic resources".

### Two-Child Policy (2016)

China scrapped its decades-old one-child policy in 2016, replacing it with a two-child limit which has failed to lead to a sustained upsurge in births.

-   Goal: To combat aging population and labor shortages.

In the last few years, despite the end of the one-child policy in 2016 and the government encouraging larger families, fertility rates have dropped to one. The fall in fertility today is driven less by policy and more by social and economic changes.

### Three-Child Policy (2021)

China has formally revised its laws to allow couples to have up to three children, to boost the birth rate.

-   Goal: To improve the population structure and cope with an aging society.

Question: How a three-child policy might mean more children when the two-child version didn't and why birth restrictions have remained here at all given the demographic trend?

- Generations of Chinese people have lived without siblings and are used to small families - affluence has meant less need for multiple children to become family-supporting workers, and young professionals say they'd rather give one child more advantages than spread their income among several kids.

## World population growth rate

As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the world population growth rate was estimated to be around 1.05% per year. However, this growth rate is not evenly distributed across different regions of the world, and some countries and regions are experiencing higher population growth rates than others.

It's worth noting that population growth rates can change over time due to various factors, such as changes in birth rates, mortality rates, and migration patterns. Additionally, population growth rates can have significant impacts on issues such as resource consumption, environmental sustainability, and social and economic development.
