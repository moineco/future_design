# Climate Change: The Ultimate Challenge for Economics

## Climate change looms over our future

The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2018 to William D. Nordhaus “for integrating climate change into long-run macroeconomic analysis” and Paul M. Romer “for integrating technological innovations into long-run macroeconomic analysis.”

### Climate change as a global public good (bad)

Let's begin with the fundamental problem posed by climate change – that it is a public good (bad) or (negative) externality. Such activities are ones whose costs or benefits spill outside the market and are not captured in market prices. These include positive spillovers like new knowledge and negative spillovers like pollution.

The theory of public goods was developed by Paul Samuelson (1954), the first American Nobel laureate in economics, and it is fundamental to environmental economics today.

The theory of public goods applies as well to climate change. Here, we are speaking of a negative externality or “public bad” in the form of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rather than a public good of improved knowledge.

Climate change is a particularly thorny externality because it is global. Global externalities, whose impacts are indivisibly spread around the entire world, are not new.

In earlier centuries, countries faced religious conflicts, marauding armies, and the spread of infectious diseases such as the plague. In the modern world, the older global challenges have not disappeared, while new ones have arisen – including not only global warming but others such as the threat of nuclear proliferation, international financial crises, and the growing threat of cyberwarfare.

Global warming is the most significant of all environmental externalities.

### The circular flow of global warming science, impacts, and policy

The basic structure of the DICE (Dynamic Integrated model of Climate and the Economy) model is shown in following figure.

The figure displays the logical circular flow from emissions to climate to impacts then to policies and closing the circle back to emissions. The global warming problem
starts at the upper left box, where economic growth and distorted price signals lead to rapidly rising emissions of $CO_2$ into the atmosphere. The arrow then
moves to the box at the upper right, where the $CO_2$ concentrations and other forces lead to major changes in the climate system. The changing climate then produces impacts on human and natural systems in the box on the lower right. Finally, the box on the lower left shows societal responses to the threat of climate change.

The arrows in the figure represent the linkages between the different parts of the economy-climate-impacts-politics-economy nexus. However, the last two arrows are dashes with question marks. These links do not yet exist. There are no effective international agreements as of 2019 to limit the emissions of carbon dioxide ($CO_2$) and other greenhouse gases. If we continue along our current path of virtually no policies, then the dashed arrows will fade away, and the globe will continue on the dangerous path of unrestrained global warming.

So, what is the DICE model in mathematics? Conceptually, it is a constrained non-linear dynamic optimization model with an infinite horizon. More precisely, in slightly simplified form, we can write it as follows in two equations.

$$ 
\max_{c(t)} W = \max_{c(t)} \left[ \int_0^\infty U\left(c(t)\right) e^{-\rho t} \, dt \right].......(1) $$

subject to


$$ c(t) = M \left[y(t);z(t); \alpha; \epsilon(t)\right].......(2)$$

In the equations, c(t) is consumption; y(t) are other endogenous variables (such as global temperature); z(t) are exogenous variables (such as population); α are parameters (such as climate sensitivity); ρ is the pure rate of time preference; and ε(t) are random variables in the stochastic versions. This highly simplified representation shows an optimization of the path of consumption in (1) subject to a complex constraint in (2). The most challenging part of constructing the DICE model is to determine the structural constraints in (2). In the current version, there are about 20 equations necessary to represent the complex interactions shown in previous figure.
