# Globalization and the Environment

## What is Globalization

Definition: Globalization describes the growing interdependence of the world’s economies, cultures, and populations, brought about by cross-border trade in goods and services, technology, and flows of investment, people, and information.

Globalization significantly impacts the environment by increasing pollution (transportation, industry), deforestation, and resource depletion through heightened trade, production, and consumption, but it also offers potential benefits like diffusing cleaner technologies and fostering global environmental regulations, creating a complex dynamic where economic growth often clashes with ecological sustainability, requiring careful policy to balance. 

### Negative Impacts

- Pollution: Increased global shipping and manufacturing raise greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change, ocean acidification, and poor air quality, with major issues like plastic waste accumulation.

- Deforestation & Land Degradation: Expansion of commercial agriculture, urbanization, and logging clear forests, leading to habitat loss, soil erosion, desertification, and biodiversity decline.

- Resource Depletion: Greater demand for resources like fresh water and fossil fuels strains natural supplies, particularly in developing nations.

 
## Positive Impacts

- Technology Diffusion: Globalization can spread cleaner technologies and more efficient production methods globally.

- Environmental Governance: It fosters international cooperation, leading to global agreements and coordinated environmental practices (e.g., treaties on tropical timber).

- Economic Growth & Reform: While sometimes driving pollution, growth also provides resources for environmental investment; some research suggests political globalization can moderate emissions. 

## The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)

Definition: The environmental Kuznets curve suggests that economic development initially leads to a deterioration in the environment, but after a certain level of economic growth, a society begins to improve its relationship with the environment and levels of environmental degradation reduces.

### The inverted U-shaped EKC

-   Empirical evidence suggests that as economies grow, they initially do increasing environmental damage--but they become more environmentally friendly once they become sufficiently rich. China, where the environment is deteriorating as the economy expands, is in effect moving from A to B. Richer countries may be moving from C to D, using some of their growth to improve the environment.

-   In the early 1990s, Princeton economists Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger, studying the relationship between national income levels and pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, found that these offsetting effects of economic growth lead to a distinctive "inverted U" relationship between per-capita income and environmental damage known as the environmental Kuznets curve. This concept, whose relevance has been confirmed by a great deal of further research, is illustrated schematically in Figure 9a.

-   The idea is that as a country's income per-capita rises due to economic growth, the initial effect is growing damage to the environment. Thus, China, whose economy has surged in recent decades, is in effect moving from point A to point B: As the country burns more coal in its power plants and produces more goods in its factories, it emits more sulfur dioxide into the air and dumps more effluent into its rivers.

-   But when a country gets sufficiently rich, it can afford to take action to protect the environment. As the United States has grown richer in recent decades, it has also moved to limit pollution. For example, cars are required to have catalytic converters that reduce smog, and a government-licensing scheme limits emissions of sulfur dioxide from power plants. In terms of Figure 9a, the United States has on some fronts, such as local air pollution, moved from C to D: growing richer and doing less damage to the environment. Figure 9b shows different stages of EKC.

-   Below is the UK CO2 output per capita. In a way it neatly mirrors the environmental Kuznets curve. From 1820 to 1970, CO2 pollution increased from 2 tonnes per capita to 12 tonnes. But, since then it has fallen. A large part of this reflects the decline in coal production, one of the main stays of the industrial revolution.

### The N-shaped EKC

-   Scholars supporting N-shaped EKC have proposed a different theory. They believed that even at a higher stage of economic development if innovation cannot keep up with the speed of economic growth and the increase in technological effects is slower than the scale effect, environmental pollution may reappear (Lorente and Álvarez-Herranz, 2016).

-   In other words, the shape of the EKC may extend from an inverted U-shape to an N-shape. This N-shaped model assumes that economic growth leads to environmental degradation that reverses with economic progress after reaching a positive peak and that pollution levels approach a negative peak before starting to rise again with further economic progress.

-   Compared with the inverted U-shaped EKC, the most critical gap lies in the rebound of environmental pollution in the third stage. Scholars refer to this pattern as the technological obsolescence effect, representing the re-emergence of scale effects and overcoming the compositional and technological effects that preceded the second turning point (Lorente and Álvarez-Herranz, 2016; Balsalobre-Lorente et al., 2018).

-   The emergence of this phenomenon is believed to be related to neglected environmental regulations and slow technological innovation.

## Causes of Environmental Kuznets curve

-   **Empirical evidence of declining pollution levels with economic growth**. Studies found that higher economic growth in the US led to increased use of cars, but at the same time – due to regulation, levels of air pollution (in particular sulphur dioxide levels declined). See: Kuznets curve a Primer

-   **Spare income with growth**. With higher rates of economic growth, people have more discretionary income after paying for basic necessities; therefore, they are more amenable to paying higher prices in return for better environmental standards.

-   **Focus on living standards as opposed to real GDP**. Traditional economic theory concentrates on increasing real GDP and rates of economic growth. But there is a growing awareness the link between economic growth and living standards can be weak. Focusing on living standards can become politically popular.

-   **Improved technology**. The primary driving force behind long-term economic growth is improved technology and higher productivity. With higher productivity, we can see higher output, with less raw materials used. For example, since the 1950s, the technology of car use has significantly improved fuel efficiency. In the 1950s, many cars had very low miles per gallon. In recent years, car manufacturers have made strides in reducing fuel consumption and have started to develop hybrid technology.

-   **Solar and renewable energy**. A good example of how improved technology has reduced potential for environmental damage is the progress in solar technology. In recent years, the cost of solar energy has significantly fallen – raising the prospect of clean technology. See: Solar technology

-   **De-industrialization**. Initially, economic development leads to shifting from farming to manufacturing. This leads to greater environmental degradation. However, increased productivity and rising real incomes see a third shift from industrial to the service sector. An economy like the UK has seen industrialization shrink as a share of the economy. The service sector usually has a lower environmental impact than manufacturing.

-   **Role of government regulation**. Economic growth and development usually see a growth in the size of government as a share of GDP. The government are able to implement taxes and regulations in an attempt to solve environmental externalities which harm health and living standards.

-   **Diminishing marginal utility of income**. Rising income has a diminishing marginal utility. The benefit from your first £10,000 annual income is very high. But, if income rises from £90,000- £100,000 the gain is very limited in comparison. Having a very high salary is of little consolation if you live with environmental degradation (e.g. congestion, pollution and ill health). Therefore a rational person who is seeing rising incomes will begin to place greater stress on improving other aspects of living standards.

## Criticisms of Kuznets Environmental Curve

-   **Empirical evidence is mixed**. There is no guarantee that economic growth will see a decline in pollutants. We have seen a fall in visible pollution (e.g. London smogs of the 1950s). But, a growth in less visible pollutants, such as Amonia, Nitrous Oxide (N₂O)- increasing at about \~1 ppb per year in recent decades and Methane 2.6× higher today than in the 1700s.

-   **Pollution is not simply a function of income, but many factors**. For example, the effectiveness of government regulation, the development of the economy, population levels.

-   **Global pollution**. Many developed economies have seen a reduction in industry and growth in the service sector, but they are still importing goods from developing countries. In that sense, they are exporting environmental degradation. Pollution may reduce in the UK, US, but countries who export to these countries are seeing higher levels of environmental degradation. One example is with regard to deforestation. Higher-income countries tend to stop the process of deforestation, but at the same time, they still import meat and furniture from countries who are creating farmland out of forests.

-   **Growth leads to greater resource use**. Some economists argue that there is a degree of reduced environmental degradation post-industrialization. But, if the economy continues to expand, then inevitably some resources will continue to be used in greater measure. There is no guarantee that long-term levels of environmental degradation will continue to fall.

-   **Countries with the highest GDP have highest levels of CO2 emission**. For example, US has CO2 emissions of 17.564 tonnes per-capita. Ethiopia has by comparison 0.075 tonnes per-capita. China’s CO2 emissions have increased from 1,500 million tonnes in 1981 to 8,000 million tonnes in 2009.

## Trade liberalization and Environmental Kuznets Curve 

-   Trade liberalization is often advocated on the grounds that it will promote economic growth. To the extent that it succeeds in accomplishing this end, it will raise per-capita income. Will this improve or worsen environmental quality? It depends which side of the environmental Kuznets curve an economy is on. In their original paper, which was in part a response to critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement who argued that the agreement would be environmentally harmful, Grossman and Krueger suggested that Mexico might be on the right side of the curve---that is, to the extent that NAFTA raises Mexican income, it might actually lead to a reduction in environmental damage.

-   However, the environmental Kuznets curve does not, by any means, necessarily imply that globalization is good for the environment. In fact, it's fairly easy to make the argument that at a world level, globalization has indeed harmed the environment---at least so far.

-   This argument would run as follows: The biggest single beneficiary of globalization has arguably been China, whose export-led economy has experienced incredible growth since 1980. Meanwhile, the single biggest environmental issue is surely climate change: There is broad scientific consensus that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are leading to a rise in the Earth's average temperature.

-   China's boom has been associated with a huge increase in its emissions of carbon dioxide. Figure 9c shows carbon dioxide emissions of the United States, Europe, and China from 1980 to 2011. In 1980, China was a minor factor in global warming; by 2008, it was, by a substantial margin, the world's leading emitter of greenhouse gases. It's important to realize, though, that the problem here isn't globalization per se---it's China's economic success, which has to some extent come as a result of globalization. And despite environmental concerns, it's difficult to argue that China's growth, which has raised hundreds of millions of people out of dire poverty, is a bad thing.

## The Problem of "Pollution Havens"

When ships get too old to continue operating, they are disassembled to recover their scrap metal and other materials. One way to look at "ship-breaking" is that it is a form of recycling: Instead of leaving a ship to rust, a ship-breaking firm extracts and reuses its components. Ultimately, this salvaging means that less iron ore needs to be mined, less oil extracted, and so on. One might expect ship-breaking to be good for the environment. The task itself, however, can be environmentally hazardous: Everything from the residual oil in a ship's tanks to the plastic in its chairs and interior fittings, if not handled carefully, can be toxic to the local environment.

Pollution is the classic example of a negative externality---a cost that individuals impose on others but don't pay for. That's why pollution is a valid reason for government intervention. However, different forms of pollution have very different geographical reach---and only those that extend across national boundaries obviously justify international concern.

Thus, to the extent that Indian ship breaking pollutes the local environment. this is a problem for India; it's less clear that it is a problem for other countries. Similarly, air pollution in Mexico City is a problem for Mexico; it's not clear why it's a valid U.S. interest. On the other hand, emissions of carbon dioxide affect the future climate for all countries: They're an international externality and deserve to be the subject of international negotiation.
