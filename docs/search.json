    "text": "Preface\nWhat types of social systems are necessary if we are to leave future generations sustainable natural environments and sustainable societies? Why do we keep changing the future Earth’s environment and taking away resources from future generations? Following the Industrial Revolution various innovations took place and we began using massive amounts of fossil fuel. Despite being the cause of the various future failures, this has built a society that blindly focuses on economic growth.\nAn ideal society seeks to balance the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Through “future design”, we can foster harmony between human activities and the natural environment, promote social equity, and ensure economic prosperity in a way that is regenerative and resilient.\nThis course aims to explore the intersection of “future design” and “sustainable development”, delving into various topics, methodologies, and case studies that exemplify these principles in action. From sustainable architecture and urban planning to circular economy practices, renewable energy solutions, and socially responsible design, we will embark on a journey that challenges conventional thinking and empowers us to envision and create a more sustainable future.\nThis course also acknowledges the inherent complexity and multifaceted nature of the challenges we face. It recognizes that achieving sustainability requires a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach, involving experts from diverse fields, as well as active engagement from communities, businesses, and policymakers. By embracing this shared responsibility, we can forge a collective vision and work towards a common goal.\nThis course will consider the existence of Future design in an intersection of Experimental Economics, Environmental Economics and Public Policy.",

    "text": "1.2 Meaning and Purpose of Life\n\n1.2.1 What is the meaning of your life?\nHaving a meaning in life is one of the most fundamental human needs. However, for most people, finding their meaning in life is not obvious. Modern life has a way of distracting people from their true goals and many people find it hard to define the meaning in life. Especially at younger ages, people are searching for meaning in life, but this has been found to be unrelated to actually finding meaning (Schippers and Ziegler, 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\nViktor Frankl, an Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist who had survived the holocaust, used his experience to formulate a theory on the meaning of life. He concluded that life can have meaning even in the most impoverished circumstances (Frankl, 2014).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 What is the purpose of your life?\nPeople with a purpose in life are less likely to experience conflict when making health-related decisions and are more likely to self-regulate when making these decisions and consequently experience better (mental) health outcomes (Kang et al., 2019).\nHaving a purpose in life can aid in overcoming stress, depression, anxiety, and other psychological problems (Kim et al., 2014; Freedland, 2019).\nPurpose in life has been related to a decrease in mortality across all ages (Hill and Turiano, 2014). It thus appears that many benefits may be gained by enhancing meaning and purpose in life.\nThe best day of your life is the one on which you decide your life is your own. No apologies or excuses. No one to lean on, rely on, or blame. The gift is yours – it is an amazing journey – and you alone are responsible for the quality of it. This is the day your life really begins (- Bob Moawad).",

    "section": "3.3 Benefits of Capitalism",
    "text": "3.3 Benefits of Capitalism\nThe main benefit of capital is that it provides a strong incentive and motivation to produce, grow, innovate, improve, and move forward in a positive way. Those who believe in a free market system argue that free markets and competition result in superior businesses and, thus, better products and services.\nSome of the the potential advantages of capitalism are listed below:\n\n3.3.1 Capitalism encourages efficient production\nMixed-market capitalism rewards the most efficient producers since they can sell more goods and earn more money than inefficient producers. Companies strive to be reliable suppliers for consumers, leading to large-scale availability of products to meet growing or high demand.\n\n\n3.3.2 Capitalism facilitates rapid economic growth\nLimited government intervention encourages producers and consumers to accumulate wealth by offering their services to as many parties as they can. Before the widespread adoption of capitalism in the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, resources were often acquired through conquest. Under capitalism, resources are required through free trade between any two parties allowing the producers of any resource to accumulate wealth and satisfying the needs of the consumer.\n\n\n3.3.3 Capitalism rewards innovation\nCapitalism provides incentives for economic growth. Exciting new products may satisfy consumer demand better than existing products, and competitors will recognize that they can increase their profit by producing an innovative product. Higher profits mean a higher accumulation of wealth, which can further incentivize people to invest in bigger and better technologies and systems.\n\n\n3.3.4 Capitalism offers social and financial freedom\nThose who live in capitalist societies are allowed to choose their own occupations to earn money and have the freedom to choose where to invest or spend their money to pursue a higher standard of living. Competitive market economies encourage successful businesses to invest in up-and-coming companies, thus increasing the quality of production.\n\n\n3.3.5 Does Absolute Capitalism Exist?\nIn theory, yes. In practice, no country in the world has ever achieved a 100% capitalist, “laissez-faire,” or free-market economy. All capitalist economies are mixed to one degree or another. The following are some high-profile examples.\n\n\n3.3.6 Is America Capitalist?\nYes, but not completely. The United States is actually referred to as a mixed market economy, meaning that it blends characteristics of both capitalism and socialism.\nIn the United States, the means of production (such as manufacturers or importers) are privately owned and operated for profit. This is a clearly capitalist approach. However, because the economy has regulations, taxation, and some subsidization, the United States is not a purely capitalist society. The government has at least partial control over education, roads, health care, and postal deliveries. It also provides subsidies to sectors including oil companies, financial companies, and agricultural producers. Additionally, private businesses must register with government agencies, and certain types of companies need government-approved licenses.\n\n\n3.3.7 Is Japan Capitalist?\nYes, but in an altered form. Japan is a capitalist country in the form of “collective capitalism”. In Japan’s collective capitalist system, workers are usually compensated with job security, pensions, and social protection by their employers in return for loyalty and hard work. Collective capitalism focuses on long-term relationships, such as companies owning shares in other companies, resulting in cooperation between companies because they are invested in one other’s prosperity.",

    "text": "3.4 Alternative Economic Systems\nWhile capitalism isn’t perfect, there are not many other shining examples of other economic systems. The most common alternative systems are:\n\n3.4.1 Socialism\nSocialism is the closest alternative to capitalism. It provides a system where both individuals and governments own the means of production, and they may compete. For example, in the oil industry, there may be a combination of state-owned oil producers and privately-owned ones. It gives the government more control over strategic assets and may provide more revenues than just collecting taxes.\nThe downside of socialism is that the government may not be as efficient an operator, and thus, will not be as profitable as the private competitors. It may also mean the state-owned companies get favorable terms and treatment.\n\n\n3.4.2 Communism [共産主義]\nThe communist economic system is one step further than socialism where the government owns the entire means of production (i.e., all businesses are state-owned) and the government provides all citizens with a fixed standard of living. Communism is the opposite of capitalism in that all businesses are state-owned, the economy is centrally planned, and the allocation of capital is not a free market.\n\n\n3.4.3 Fascism\nFascism is a nationalistic type of economic system where the government forces business to place the interest of the nation above their company’s. In fascism, the ruling party and central planners of the country dictate what business owners need to do. The primary focus of this system is on nation-building, and it may be coupled with strong military force.",

He argued that capitalism’s internal contradictions would eventually make it unsustainable.",

    "section": "3.6 Core Problems of Capitalism According to Marx",
    "text": "3.6 Core Problems of Capitalism According to Marx\n\n3.6.1 Exploitation of Labor\nMarx argued that capitalism exploits workers by extracting surplus value from their labor. Capitalists pay workers less than the value they produce, keeping the difference as profit. This surplus value is the basis of capital accumulation. Workers sell their labor power as a commodity, but they have no control over what they produce or how profits are distributed. As profits rise, wages stagnate or fall, deepening inequality. This exploitation is systemic—not a result of individual greed but a built-in feature of capitalist production. For Marx, this unequal exchange laid the foundation for class antagonism and the eventual downfall of the capitalist system.\n\n\n3.6.2 Concentration of Wealth\nCapitalism, according to Marx, inevitably concentrates wealth and capital in the hands of a few. As competition forces smaller businesses out, capital consolidates into monopolies or oligopolies. Wealth accumulates not because of merit but through ownership of capital and control over production. The rich get richer through passive income, while workers remain dependent on wages. This concentration leads to the political domination of the capitalist class, as economic power translates into influence over laws, media, and institutions. Marx saw this as a threat to democracy and social stability, predicting that wealth inequality would intensify class struggle and drive revolutionary change.\n\n\n3.6.3 Crisis of Overproduction\nMarx believed capitalism suffers from recurring crises caused by overproduction and underconsumption. Capitalist firms must constantly expand production to compete and increase profits. However, workers—who are also consumers—can’t afford to buy all the goods produced because they’re paid too little. This leads to excess inventory, factory shutdowns, and mass layoffs. Instead of meeting human needs, production is driven by profit motives, creating waste and inefficiency. These crises are not anomalies but symptoms of capitalism’s internal contradictions. Marx argued that each crisis would be worse than the last, eventually pushing the system to its breaking point.\n\n\n3.6.4 Commodification\nCapitalism turns everything—including labor, nature, and even social relationships—into commodities for sale. Marx saw this as a profound distortion of human values. In the pursuit of profit, use-value (what something is for) becomes secondary to exchange-value (what it sells for). Education, healthcare, and art are no longer public goods but commercial products. Human needs become market-driven, and non-market activities lose value. This commodification erodes genuine social bonds and replaces them with market transactions. Marx believed that when everything is for sale, human dignity is diminished, and society becomes governed by impersonal market logic.\n\n\n3.6.5 Class Struggle\nMarx claimed that class struggle is the driving force of historical change under capitalism. The interests of capitalists and workers are fundamentally opposed. Capitalists aim to maximize profit, often by suppressing wages and cutting labor costs. Workers, on the other hand, seek better pay and conditions. This conflict cannot be resolved within the system because it stems from its basic structure. Workers have no control over production, and capitalists rely on their labor to generate profit. Marx argued that as class consciousness grows, workers will eventually unite, overthrow the bourgeoisie, and build a classless society.\n\n\n3.6.6 Imperialism\nMarx believed capitalism expands globally to escape internal contradictions and maintain profits. As domestic markets saturate, capital seeks new markets, resources, and cheap labor abroad. This leads to colonization, war, and the exploitation of foreign populations. Imperialism allows the capitalist class to shift crises outward and delay collapse. However, it also spreads capitalist contradictions to new regions, sowing resistance and unrest. Marx saw imperialism not as a choice but a necessity for capitalism’s survival. It deepens global inequality, transferring wealth from the periphery to the core, and makes global revolution more likely.\n\n\n3.6.7 Environmental Degradation\nCapitalism prioritizes profit over ecological sustainability, leading to environmental destruction. Marx observed that capitalist production treats nature as an endless resource and a dumping ground for waste. There’s no incentive to preserve ecosystems or reduce pollution when short-term profit is at stake. This results in soil depletion, deforestation, and climate instability. Marx described this as a “metabolic rift” between human society and nature—a breakdown of the balance required for long-term survival. He argued that only a system focused on social needs, not profit, could restore harmony with the environment.\n\n\n3.6.8 Alienation\nUnder capitalism, workers become alienated from their labor, the products they create, and their own human potential. Marx identified four types of alienation: from the product, the process, fellow workers, and self. In capitalist production, labor becomes mechanical and repetitive, reducing human creativity to monotonous tasks. Workers have no say in what they make or how it’s made, disconnecting them from the fruits of their work. Their relationships with others are transactional, not communal. Most damagingly, labor becomes merely a means to survive rather than a fulfilling activity. Marx saw this alienation as a psychological and social crisis deeply embedded in capitalist society.",

Income inequality continues to rise, with billionaires controlling more wealth than entire nations. Workers face job insecurity, wage stagnation, and automation threats, echoing Marx’s warnings about exploitation and alienation. Climate change, driven by profit-centered industries, reflects the environmental degradation Marx foresaw. Even financial crises, like the 2008 crash, follow the pattern of overproduction and under-consumption he described.\nGlobal supply chains and corporate imperialism also mirror his insights on expansion and exploitation. Multinational companies extract resources from the Global South while maintaining profits in the Global North. These dynamics reveal that Marx’s analysis wasn’t just historical—it provides a framework to understand capitalism’s enduring problems and systemic contradictions in the modern world.",

His analysis challenges us to look beyond surface-level reforms and question the deeper logic of capitalism itself. Whether one agrees with his solutions or not, understanding his critique is essential for anyone serious about economic justice, sustainability, and systemic change. As crises intensify globally, Marx’s ideas continue to provoke debate and inspire movements seeking a more equitable and humane future.",

As the world’s most populous country, China was never far from the debate. In 1979, China designed its one-child policy, which was rolled out nationally from 1980 to curb population growth by limiting couples to having just one child.\nBy this point, China’s fertility rate — the number of children per woman — had already fallen quickly in the early 1970s, as you can see in the chart.\nWhile China’s one-child policy restricted many families, there were exceptions to the rule. Enforcement differed widely by province and between urban and rural areas. Many couples were allowed to have another baby if their first was a girl. Other couples paid a fine for having more than one. As a result, fertility rates never dropped close to one.\nThe one-child policy also led to a severe gender imbalance in the country. The traditional preference for male children led to large numbers of girls being abandoned or placed in orphanages, or cases of sex-selective abortions or even female infanticide.\n“This poses problems for the marriage market, especially for men with less socioeconomic resources”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Two-Child Policy (2016)\nChina scrapped its decades-old one-child policy in 2016, replacing it with a two-child limit which has failed to lead to a sustained upsurge in births.\n\nGoal: To combat aging population and labor shortages.\n\nIn the last few years, despite the end of the one-child policy in 2016 and the government encouraging larger families, fertility rates have dropped to one. The fall in fertility today is driven less by policy and more by social and economic changes.\n\n\n4.3.3 Three-Child Policy (2021)\nChina has formally revised its laws to allow couples to have up to three children, to boost the birth rate.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-58277473\n\nGoal: To improve the population structure and cope with an aging society.\n\n\n\n\nChina’s fertility rate\n\n\nQuestion: How a three-child policy might mean more children when the two-child version didn’t and why birth restrictions have remained here at all given the demographic trend?\n\nGenerations of Chinese people have lived without siblings and are used to small families - affluence has meant less need for multiple children to become family-supporting workers, and young professionals say they’d rather give one child more advantages than spread their income among several kids.",

In the presence of few people, environment can cleansing itself automatically\n\nIf there were few people in the world, the earth’s environment would be very forgiving and capable of absorbing most of what humans throw at it, cleansing itself automatically. The days of low population on the earth have passed; the total number of people on the planet and particularly the density of people in some parts of the planet magnify the size of environmental insults, overloading the capacity of the earth for self-cleansing.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1(Source: Ordukhani et. al, 2022)\n\n\nB. Environmental issues often take a backseat to other more pressing needs related to survival\n\nIncome is also important, not only because rich people tend to consume more and thus generate more pollution, but also because the environment is often viewed as a luxury good. For the poor who struggle to keep food on the table, environmental issues often take a backseat to other more pressing needs related to survival. As people become wealthier, they turn their attention increasingly to the quality of their living environment, which ultimately is the planet.\n\nC. Challenges to define right amount of pollution\n\nWhat are the typical issues facing most countries of the world with regard to environmental policy? In developed countries, pollution and the preservation of natural environments (e.g., wilderness areas) are major concerns. Pollution problems usually involve two major issues-what is the right amount of pollution and how can we get polluters to control their emissions?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2(Source: https://climatekids.nasa.gov/air-pollution/)\n\n\n\nDetermining the right amount of pollution is not easy. Pollution is generated as a by-product of producing goods. To determine the costs of pollution control it is necessary to understand the structure of goods production and how costs will differ for different levels of pollution. Determining the right amount of pollution also involves determining damages from pollution. The words “damages from pollution” deceptively suggest that this is a natural science question, such as counting the dead fish on a polluted lake or determining the level of pollution at which people begin to get sick.\nAir pollution in an urban area can cause physical irritation (itchy eyes, running nose), reduced visibility, degraded visibility, decreased lung capacity, increased susceptibility to illness, and of course illness itself. Some of these effects are tangible, others are very intangible.\nEconomics is accustomed to condensing this variety of effects into a single measure the willingness to pay to reduce pollution. If pollution is bad, people are willing to devote some of their resources to eliminating the pollution.\nThe government could tell each polluter how much to emit, but this would be analogous to central planning in the old Soviet Union-we know it works up to a point but has severe problems, particularly when there are many firms and polluters involved.\nSo the “simple” job of fixing the problem of pollution is not so easy at the policy level and can involve hard-to-solve problems, many in the domain of environmental economics.\nThe examples we have used are from developed economies but a very similar analysis could apply to a developing country. Air pollution is a big problem in many cities of the developing world. Water pollution is probably the most severe environmental problem in many developing countries: water contaminated by human waste kills millions of people annually.\n\nD. Challenges to define natural environments\n\nAnother important type of policy question is the preservation of natural environments, broadly defined. This could involve preserving wild and scenic areas from development or protecting animal and plant species from extinction.\nThe point is that environmental protection usually involves the intervention of governments in the economy and it is often difficult to decide on the proper extent and nature of that intervention. Environmental economics as it is applied to real environmental problems can be invaluable in helping make those important decisions.",

    "text": "5.4 Environmental Economics and Economics\n\nEconomics is a well-developed discipline with an extensive body of theory, a paradigm associated with how the economic world works, strong empirical tools, and a number of branches, or fields of study, associated with pieces of the economy.\nThe fundamental building blocks of economics are contained in microeconomics- the theory of the consumer, the theory of the firm, and the theory of market interaction. This forms the basis for nearly all of economics. Related to microeconomics is the branch of statistics applied to economic phenomena— econometrics. Microeconomics permeates all of economics and econometrics permeates all of applied economics.\nBranching out from basic microeconomic theory are the several fundamental fields of economics. These would include macroeconomics (the study of aggregate as opposed to individual phenomena), public finance (the study of goods not provided by the market and the study of taxation), industrial organization (the in depth study of how firms interact with each other and with consumers and organize themselves into industries), and international trade (concerned with how distinct and independent economies interact). Each of these major fields is concerned with major portions of economic activity and each has unique contributions to make to the overall study of economics.\nEnvironmental economics is an applied field, like many other applied fields in economics. Much of environmental economics involves adapting concepts developed in other branches of economics (particularly public finance and industrial organization) and applying them to environmental problems. Some aspects of environmental economics are unique to the field (such as valuation, mentioned above) and have potential use in economics outside of the environmental economics field.\n\nReference: Charles D.

With the human population now exceeding 8 billion people and rapid growth in per capita consumption of goods and services, humanity’s growing ecological footprint is altering the planet’s land cover, rivers and oceans, climate system, biogeochemical cycles, and the functioning of its ecosystems (Foley, J., et. al., 2005).\nPollution is a problem historically\nPollution problems are not new to mankind. It has always been the case that urban areas have bad pollution problems, primarily because of the large concentrations of people. People are associated with emissions as well as being the reason pollution is damaging. What is new is the magnitude of the problem and the fact that the world is no longer infinite compared to the ability of people to pollute.\nPopulation growth and the high standard of living make the pollution problem significant\nThe enormous size of our current world’s population and the high standard of living of portions of the population are responsible for the pressures on the environment. A larger economy generates more pollution, all other things being equal; richer citizens usually demand higher levels of environmental quality. And as long as the world becomes more populated and wealthier, the pressures will only increase. This is not to say environmental problems cannot be solved, only that it will become increasingly difficult to protect the earth’s environment.\nWe focus on four main categories of environmental problems: (A) air pollution, (B) water pollution, (C) toxic emissions, and (D) ecosystem health.",

    "text": "6.1.1 A. Air Pollution:\n\nAir pollution is primarily a by-product of energy consumption. Impurities in fuels lead to emissions of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. It is a basic fact of chemistry that burning carbon-based fuels leads to emissions of oxidized carbon-carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. Because our atmosphere contains significant amounts of nitrogen in addition to oxygen, burning fuels inevitably leads to emissions of nitrogen oxides.\nTo a large extent, air pollutants are at their worst in urban areas, due to concentrations of people, both as sources of the pollution (directly or indirectly) and as victims of the pollution. Air pollution can lead to health problems, including sickness as well as physical irritation and reduced human performance.\n\n\n\n6.1.2 B. Water Pollution:\n\nWater pollution has traditionally been the result of organic material deposited in waterways or lakes. One particularly difficult water pollution problem is pollution of groundwater. Groundwater, water in underground aquifers, is the source of drinking water for many people. Because of the cleansing ability of the earth above the aquifer, groundwater has traditionally been relatively contaminant free.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3\n\n\n\nSurface waters, such as lakes and rivers, are the ultimate repositories of much that is deposited on the land. Lakes and rivers throughout the developed world suffer to varying degrees from excessive levels of nutrients (from agricultural runoff) and acidification. Nutrients can promote the growth of algae and phytoplankton, which increase the turbidity of the waters.\n\n\n\n6.1.3 C. Toxic Emissions:\n\nToxic chemicals in the environment have been a problem for decades. There are significant discharges of heavy metals and other toxics into the aquatic environment, even in developed countries.\nAnother serious toxic problem from the perspective of human health is lead. During this century, the most significant source of lead poisoning has been through air pollution, due to lead in motor fuels.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4(Source: www.aqi.in)\n\n\n\nAside from intentional discharges of toxics into the environment, there are two other major sources of toxics-old toxic waste sites and accidental discharges. Toxic wastes do not rapidly decay and become harmless. Some abandoned industrial sites from the nineteenth century are still considered chemically hazardous.\n\n\n\n6.1.4 D. Ecosystem Health:\n\nMost concepts of human health focus on the individual human, whereas ecosystem health treats the entire ecosystem as the unit of policy concern, not the individual animal or plant.\nAn ecosystem can be said to possess integrity when it is wild—that is, free as much as possible from human intervention today, and “unmanaged,” although not necessarily pristine. This aspect of integrity is the most significant one; it is the aspect that differentiates the wild from ecosystem health, which allows support and manipulation.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5(Coral health in St. Thomas: Wikipedia)\n\n\n\nMost of the foregoing environmental problems (air, water, toxics) are sometimes referred to as “brown” issues-associated with pollution, often from industrial sources. Some environmental issues do not directly involve pollution in the conventional sense.\nMany green issues have to do with the health of specific species of animals or plants, or ecosystems, consisting of interconnected species of animals and plants. The rapid rise in the earth’s population has inevitably placed great strain on wild ecosystems around the planet.\n\n\n\n6.1.5 E. Ecological Footprint:\nThe Ecological Footprint (EF) is the only metric that measures how much nature we have and how much nature we use. Ecological Footprint accounting measures the demand on and supply of nature.\nOn the demand side, the Ecological Footprint adds up all the biologically productive areas for which a population, a person or a product competes. It measures the ecological assets that a given population or product requires to produce the natural resources it consumes (including plant-based food and fiber products, livestock and fish products, timber and other forest products, space for urban infrastructure) and to absorb its waste, especially carbon emissions.\nThe Ecological Footprint tracks the use of productive surface areas. Typically these areas are: cropland, grazing land, fishing grounds, built-up land, forest area, and carbon demand on land.\nOn the supply side, a city, state or nation’s biocapacity represents the productivity of its ecological assets (including cropland, grazing land, forest land, fishing grounds, and built-up land). These areas, especially if left unharvested, can also serve to absorb the waste we generate, especially our carbon emissions from burning fossil fuel.",

    "section": "6.2 Environmental regulation",
    "text": "6.2 Environmental regulation\nThere is a surprising amount of similarity in how countries around the world have responded to environmental problems. I will discuss about very superficial examination of environmental protection regulation in the European Union, Russia, and the United States.\n\n6.2.1 European Union\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6(Source: www.politics-dz.com)\n\n\n\n6.2.1.1 Regulatory Approach:\n\nEuropean Union policy with regard to the environment is implemented through the issuing of what are known as directives. A directive is an EU “law” that is binding on the governments of member countries, requiring each government to pass its own legislation to implement the directive.\nOne of the most widely noticed directives was the 1988 directive that set forth sulfur emission controls for large electricity-generating stations. The impetus for EU level action was the problem of acid rain and acid deposition, which are pollution problems that do not respect national borders.\nThe directive is very specific as to how much emissions may come from new power plants; in fact, the directive specified the pollution control technology to be used on most new power plants.\n\n\n\n6.2.1.2 The Use of Economic Incentives:\n\nThere is a longer history of the use of economic incentives in the EU than in most other parts of the world.\nOne of the clearest economic incentives in use in the EU is the German Water Pollution charge, instituted in 1976 and implemented in 1981. The charge is established at the federal (national) level. It is left up to the states of Germany to implement and enforce the fee. However, it is unclear how much pollution has been reduced as a result of the fee.\nAnother charge that appears to have some incentive effects is the Dutch charge on the discharge of organic material into sewer systems. The problem was how to pay for the water treatment facilities necessary to improve river water quality. Somewhat logically, the parties using the system were charged a fee, and the fee was based on the load the sources would place on the treatment facility. Thus the legislative motivation appears to be simply revenue raising.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 The Russian Federation\n\n6.2.2.1 Regulatory Approach:\n\nMuch of the Russian approach to environmental protection has its origins in the Soviet Union. The 1970s was the beginning of significant Soviet actions to protect the environment. Both water pollution and air pollution controls were instituted in this period, along with the establishment of the country’s basic framework of pollution regulation. The then Soviet and now Russian regulatory approach relies on health-based ambient standards for a wide variety of pollutants.\nOne of the major differences between environmental regulation in Russia and the rest of the world is the use of the “environmental fund,” though in recent years it has been absorbed into the general budget. The environmental fund is a major financial resource to be used to help clean up the environment and finance pollution control measures. Funds (pots of money) are associated with each level of environmental regulation-federal, regional, and local.\n\n\n\n6.2.2.2 The Use of Economic Incentives:\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Russia makes extensive use of emission fees (as do many other countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union). In the late 1980s the Soviet Union was experimenting with emission fees and these were embraced by Russia in the early 1990s. The original intent of the emission fee was to finance the environmental funds. If the environmental funds were in turn to pay for environmental protection, it seemed logical that polluters should contribute to the fund based on their emission levels.\nSeveral studies of the emission fee system report that the fee levels are too low to provide much of an incentive for pollution control. Despite these findings, the fee system will be important to monitor as Russia’s market economy evolves in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 United States of America\n\n6.2.3.1 Regulatory Approach:\n\nThe United States is a federal system with some powers vested and exercised at the national level and some powers residing at the level of the state. Although environmental protection legislation dates to the nineteenth century or before (as in many countries), substantive and major national environmental legislation was first passed in the 1960s.\nThe post-World War II period saw rapid growth in the U.S. economy, along with increasing stress on the environment, increased per-capita income, and thus increased demand for environmental quality.\nCalifornia took action in the early 1960s to establish emission standards for automobiles. This was quickly followed by national legislation requiring manufacturers to install certain antipollution devices on new cars and, eventually, to meet ever-tightening limits on emissions of particular pollutants per mile traveled.\n\n\n\n6.2.3.2 The Use of Economic Incentives:\n\nIn 1990 a new market in sulfur emissions was established by legislation in an attempt to reduce sulfur emissions that lead to acid deposition (acid rain). At the time of the legislation, approximately 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide were emitted annually in the United States. The goal was to cut that in half. To accomplish that goal, a system of marketable emission permits was set up, phased in over a decade. This was the first major experiment in economic incentives in the United States.\nOne obvious type of economic incentive is the widespread adoption of volume-based pricing for municipal solid waste. It is now very common for households to pay by the “bag” for disposal services.\nThere have been a number of other emission trading schemes in the United States, most prominently the offset system whereby new polluters entering a heavily polluted area may pay existing polluters to reduce emissions.\n\nReferences:\n\nFoley, J.

    "text": "7.3 The Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)\nDefinition: The environmental Kuznets curve suggests that economic development initially leads to a deterioration in the environment, but after a certain level of economic growth, a society begins to improve its relationship with the environment and levels of environmental degradation reduces.\n\n7.3.1 The inverted U-shaped EKC\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that as economies grow, they initially do increasing environmental damage–but they become more environmentally friendly once they become sufficiently rich. China, where the environment is deteriorating as the economy expands, is in effect moving from A to B. Richer countries may be moving from C to D, using some of their growth to improve the environment.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Environmental Kuznet Curve\n\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Princeton economists Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger, studying the relationship between national income levels and pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, found that these offsetting effects of economic growth lead to a distinctive “inverted U” relationship between per-capita income and environmental damage known as the environmental Kuznets curve. This concept, whose relevance has been confirmed by a great deal of further research, is illustrated schematically in Figure 9a.\nThe idea is that as a country’s income per-capita rises due to economic growth, the initial effect is growing damage to the environment. Thus, China, whose economy has surged in recent decades, is in effect moving from point A to point B: As the country burns more coal in its power plants and produces more goods in its factories, it emits more sulfur dioxide into the air and dumps more effluent into its rivers.\nBut when a country gets sufficiently rich, it can afford to take action to protect the environment. As the United States has grown richer in recent decades, it has also moved to limit pollution. For example, cars are required to have catalytic converters that reduce smog, and a government-licensing scheme limits emissions of sulfur dioxide from power plants. In terms of Figure 9a, the United States has on some fronts, such as local air pollution, moved from C to D: growing richer and doing less damage to the environment. Figure 9b shows different stages of EKC.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Different stages in EKC\n\n\n\nBelow is the UK CO2 output per capita. In a way it neatly mirrors the environmental Kuznets curve. From 1820 to 1970, CO2 pollution increased from 2 tonnes per capita to 12 tonnes. But, since then it has fallen. A large part of this reflects the decline in coal production, one of the main stays of the industrial revolution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.3.2 The N-shaped EKC\n\nScholars supporting N-shaped EKC have proposed a different theory. They believed that even at a higher stage of economic development if innovation cannot keep up with the speed of economic growth and the increase in technological effects is slower than the scale effect, environmental pollution may reappear (Lorente and Álvarez-Herranz, 2016).\nIn other words, the shape of the EKC may extend from an inverted U-shape to an N-shape. This N-shaped model assumes that economic growth leads to environmental degradation that reverses with economic progress after reaching a positive peak and that pollution levels approach a negative peak before starting to rise again with further economic progress.\nCompared with the inverted U-shaped EKC, the most critical gap lies in the rebound of environmental pollution in the third stage. Scholars refer to this pattern as the technological obsolescence effect, representing the re-emergence of scale effects and overcoming the compositional and technological effects that preceded the second turning point (Lorente and Álvarez-Herranz, 2016; Balsalobre-Lorente et al., 2018).\nThe emergence of this phenomenon is believed to be related to neglected environmental regulations and slow technological innovation.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: N-shaped EKC",

    "text": "7.4 Causes of Environmental Kuznets curve\n\nEmpirical evidence of declining pollution levels with economic growth. Studies found that higher economic growth in the US led to increased use of cars, but at the same time – due to regulation, levels of air pollution (in particular sulphur dioxide levels declined). See: Kuznets curve a Primer\nSpare income with growth. With higher rates of economic growth, people have more discretionary income after paying for basic necessities; therefore, they are more amenable to paying higher prices in return for better environmental standards.\nFocus on living standards as opposed to real GDP. Traditional economic theory concentrates on increasing real GDP and rates of economic growth. But there is a growing awareness the link between economic growth and living standards can be weak. Focusing on living standards can become politically popular.\nImproved technology. The primary driving force behind long-term economic growth is improved technology and higher productivity. With higher productivity, we can see higher output, with less raw materials used. For example, since the 1950s, the technology of car use has significantly improved fuel efficiency. In the 1950s, many cars had very low miles per gallon. In recent years, car manufacturers have made strides in reducing fuel consumption and have started to develop hybrid technology.\nSolar and renewable energy. A good example of how improved technology has reduced potential for environmental damage is the progress in solar technology. In recent years, the cost of solar energy has significantly fallen – raising the prospect of clean technology. See: Solar technology\nDe-industrialization. Initially, economic development leads to shifting from farming to manufacturing. This leads to greater environmental degradation. However, increased productivity and rising real incomes see a third shift from industrial to the service sector. An economy like the UK has seen industrialization shrink as a share of the economy. The service sector usually has a lower environmental impact than manufacturing.\nRole of government regulation. Economic growth and development usually see a growth in the size of government as a share of GDP. The government are able to implement taxes and regulations in an attempt to solve environmental externalities which harm health and living standards.\nDiminishing marginal utility of income. Rising income has a diminishing marginal utility. The benefit from your first £10,000 annual income is very high. But, if income rises from £90,000- £100,000 the gain is very limited in comparison. Having a very high salary is of little consolation if you live with environmental degradation (e.g. congestion, pollution and ill health). Therefore a rational person who is seeing rising incomes will begin to place greater stress on improving other aspects of living standards.",

We have seen a fall in visible pollution (e.g. London smogs of the 1950s). But, a growth in less visible pollutants, such as Amonia, Nitrous Oxide (N₂O)- increasing at about ~1 ppb per year in recent decades and Methane 2.6× higher today than in the 1700s.\nPollution is not simply a function of income, but many factors. For example, the effectiveness of government regulation, the development of the economy, population levels.\nGlobal pollution. Many developed economies have seen a reduction in industry and growth in the service sector, but they are still importing goods from developing countries. In that sense, they are exporting environmental degradation. Pollution may reduce in the UK, US, but countries who export to these countries are seeing higher levels of environmental degradation. One example is with regard to deforestation. Higher-income countries tend to stop the process of deforestation, but at the same time, they still import meat and furniture from countries who are creating farmland out of forests.\nGrowth leads to greater resource use. Some economists argue that there is a degree of reduced environmental degradation post-industrialization. But, if the economy continues to expand, then inevitably some resources will continue to be used in greater measure. There is no guarantee that long-term levels of environmental degradation will continue to fall.\nCountries with the highest GDP have highest levels of CO2 emission. For example, US has CO2 emissions of 17.564 tonnes per-capita. Ethiopia has by comparison 0.075 tonnes per-capita. China’s CO2 emissions have increased from 1,500 million tonnes in 1981 to 8,000 million tonnes in 2009.",

    "text": "7.6 Trade liberalization and Environmental Kuznets Curve\n\nTrade liberalization is often advocated on the grounds that it will promote economic growth. To the extent that it succeeds in accomplishing this end, it will raise per-capita income. Will this improve or worsen environmental quality? It depends which side of the environmental Kuznets curve an economy is on. In their original paper, which was in part a response to critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement who argued that the agreement would be environmentally harmful, Grossman and Krueger suggested that Mexico might be on the right side of the curve—that is, to the extent that NAFTA raises Mexican income, it might actually lead to a reduction in environmental damage.\nHowever, the environmental Kuznets curve does not, by any means, necessarily imply that globalization is good for the environment. In fact, it’s fairly easy to make the argument that at a world level, globalization has indeed harmed the environment—at least so far.\nThis argument would run as follows: The biggest single beneficiary of globalization has arguably been China, whose export-led economy has experienced incredible growth since 1980. Meanwhile, the single biggest environmental issue is surely climate change: There is broad scientific consensus that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are leading to a rise in the Earth’s average temperature.\nChina’s boom has been associated with a huge increase in its emissions of carbon dioxide. Figure 9c shows carbon dioxide emissions of the United States, Europe, and China from 1980 to 2011. In 1980, China was a minor factor in global warming; by 2008, it was, by a substantial margin, the world’s leading emitter of greenhouse gases. It’s important to realize, though, that the problem here isn’t globalization per se—it’s China’s economic success, which has to some extent come as a result of globalization. And despite environmental concerns, it’s difficult to argue that China’s growth, which has raised hundreds of millions of people out of dire poverty, is a bad thing.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Carbon Dioxide Emissions (The rapid economic growth of China has turned it from a minor factor in climate change to the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide.)",

    "text": "7.7 The Problem of “Pollution Havens”\nWhen ships get too old to continue operating, they are disassembled to recover their scrap metal and other materials. One way to look at “ship-breaking” is that it is a form of recycling: Instead of leaving a ship to rust, a ship-breaking firm extracts and reuses its components. Ultimately, this salvaging means that less iron ore needs to be mined, less oil extracted, and so on. One might expect ship-breaking to be good for the environment. The task itself, however, can be environmentally hazardous: Everything from the residual oil in a ship’s tanks to the plastic in its chairs and interior fittings, if not handled carefully, can be toxic to the local environment.\nPollution is the classic example of a negative externality—a cost that individuals impose on others but don’t pay for. That’s why pollution is a valid reason for government intervention. However, different forms of pollution have very different geographical reach—and only those that extend across national boundaries obviously justify international concern.\nThus, to the extent that Indian ship breaking pollutes the local environment. this is a problem for India; it’s less clear that it is a problem for other countries. Similarly, air pollution in Mexico City is a problem for Mexico; it’s not clear why it’s a valid U.S. interest. On the other hand, emissions of carbon dioxide affect the future climate for all countries: They’re an international externality and deserve to be the subject of international negotiation.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\nPaul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Trade: Theory and Policy, 11th edition.",

About a half century ago, a biologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, warned of the “Tragedy of the Commons”’ and popularized concern with open access resources.\nThe tragedy, simply stated, is that when there are no owners of resources (such as the oceans or common grazing grounds) or if the owners are public entities which exert no control over use (such as open roads), then there is a real risk that the resources will be overused.\nSuch resources are termed open access (anyone may access them), common property (everyone owns the property and has access), or common pool (everyone is drawing from a common pool). We will use the three terms interchangeably.\nA simple example of the problem of open access is the divided highway/road (free way/motorway/autobahn), at least in cases where access is not regulated (i.e., when motorists can freely enter and leave the road). In many urban areas, these roads become highly congested, particularly at certain times of the day, and traffic may slow from a normal speed of 80 kph to much lower levels (e.g., 20 kph) or even come to a dead stop. Why does this occur? And what can be done about it?\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Public goods (Source: www.marketbusinessnews.com)\n\n\n\nAnother example comes from urban air pollution, particularly in years prior to serious regulatory attention to the problem, which began in the mid-20th century. The air shed had been open access for polluters. Factories and automobiles alike treated the urban air shed as common property-everyone’s property for waste disposal but nobody’s property in terms of regulating use. The result was over use of the air shed-excessive pollution. What options are open to fix this?\nThe decimation of the American passenger pigeon is a sad example of an open access resource resulting in extinction of a species. The pigeon stock was open access and a tasty morsel for the settlers in 19th century America. The pigeon is now extinct due to over harvesting. Why did this occur and what could have been done to prevent it?\n\n\n\n\nFigure: American passenger pigeon (Source: https://birds.fandom.com/wiki/Passenger_Pigeon)",

And the apiary provides a positive externality to the orchard in terms of the bees pollinating the apple blossoms.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Honey Bee\n\n\nDEFINITION: An externality exists when the consumption or production choices of one person or firm enters the utility or production function of another entity without that entity’s permission or compensation.",

    "text": "8.6 Public goods and bads\n\nEconomics has defined two fundamental characteristics of goods: excludability and rivalry. Excludability has to do with whether it is possible to use prices to ration individual use of the good. Rivalry has to do with whether it is desirable to ration individual use, through prices or any other means.\n\n\n8.6.1 Excludability\n\nTo be able to use prices to allocate a good, it is necessary to ensure that consumers do not consume a good unless an appropriate price has been paid. Thus ti must be possible to keep the consumer from the good. This is excludability. Not all goods are excludable.\nAn example is the fishery on the high seas. Keeping consumers (in this case fishers) from using this resource is very difficult (i.e., costly). As an example of a bad, air pollution is also nonexcludable. Air, of whatever level of cleanliness, is all around us. We cannot exclude certain people from consuming air pollution.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Fishery on the high seas\n\n\nDEFINITION: A good is excludable if it is feasible and practical to selectively allow consumers to consume the good. A bad is excludable if it is feasible and practical to selectively allow consumers to avoid consumption of the bad.\n\nWhy is excludability important? Because to attach a price to the consumption of a good or bad, we have to be able to deny that consumption if the price is not paid. This is how market allocation works. For a good, this is a straightforward concept. If I produce hamburgers, I must be able to deny you the right to consume a hamburger unless you pay for it.\nAnother example of a nonexcludable good would be a city park without a fence and entrance control. I cannot charge for admission because anyone can use the park, whether or not they have paid admission. Thus no one will pay admission. A fence and entrance control could be added, but this would be so expensive that its cost could outweigh any benefits associated with restricting entry to the park.\nGenerally, we would expect to see exclusion only when the benefits of exclusion outweigh the costs of exclusion. Exclusion must be not only technologically possible but also not too costly, relative to the benefits of exclusion (if any). This is the reason the word “practical” is used in the definition of exclusion.\nFor a bad, the concept is a little more subtle. Household garbage is excludable with the right laws on littering and trespass; it is not excludable without those laws. Suppose I have generated some household trash and wish to pay someone to consume it (i.e., store it safely). Without laws on trash disposal, whom- ever I pay to dispose of my garbage could simply leave ti by the side of the road or throw it back into my yard. With laws preventing such actions, when I pay someone to consume my trash, that person must retain control of the trash until someone else voluntarily (i.e., with pay) agrees to take it.\n\n\n8.6.1.1 Two factors play major role in excludability\n\nOne is the cost of exclusion\nThe other is the technology of exclusion and how it changes over time\nFor instance, a case applies to television, particularly those programs disseminated via satellite and cable. Historically, it has been too expensive to exclude consumers. However, with the development of low-cost signal scramblers and unscramblers, exclusion became economically feasible, particularly for high value programs such as recent films.\nEnvironmental goods have undergone some change in excludability over the past few decades, mostly through legal rather than technological changes. The simplest example is garbage (like the normal household type). Without institutions, garbage is not excludable. Without laws against littering, garbage will simply be dumped wherever convenient, much as it was in the Middle Ages in Europe when people would throw it out their window onto the street. This, however, has been defined as littering or creating a nuisance and is illegal in most locales. Consequently, garbage is now excludable. People can selectively choose to trade money and garbage. This is the economic transaction of the trash collector and the household. This legal aspect of excludability of course could also apply to ordinary goods. Without laws protecting property and outlawing stealing, all goods would be open access and exclusion would not be possible.\nWhy is excludability important? For a price system to work it must be possible to take possession of the good or bad for which the price is being paid. Without excludability, a price system cannot work.\n\n\n\n\n8.6.2 Rivalry\n\nA second important characteristic of goods is rivalry. This is a slightly more subtle concept than excludability. Rivalry pertains to the manner in which a good is consumed. As an example, compare the consumption of a bratwurst with that of a flower garden.\nFor the bratwurst, the act of consumption destroys the good and makes it unavailable for anyone else to consume. In contrast, the act of consumption of a flower garden involves light bouncing of flowers and being transmitted to the eyes of the consumer. This is fundamentally nondestructive to the flower garden and in no way diminishes the ability of someone else to “consume” the flower garden in precisely the same way.\n\nExamples of goods and bads:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRival\nNonrival\n\n\n\n\nExcludable\nPrivate goods\nGoods: Burger\nBads: Household garbage today\nClub goods\nGoods: Local public beach with access control\nBads: Water pollution in small lake\n\n\nNonexcludable\nOpen access resources\nGoods: Fishery\nBads: Household garbage in Middle Ages\nPure public goods\nGoods: National defense or\nglobal climate\nBads: Greenhouse gases\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\nCharles D.

    "text": "9.1.1 Carbon cycle\nGlobal C cycling involves the exchange of C between its four main reservoirs—the Earth’s atmosphere, soils, oceans, and crust.\nCarbon helps to regulate the Earth’s temperature, makes all life possible, is a key ingredient in the food that sustains us, and provides a major source of the energy to fuel our global economy. Humans play a major role in the carbon cycle through activities such as the burning of fossil fuels or land development.\n\n\n\nFigure: Global Carbon Cycle (Source: https://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/resources/155/global-carbon-cycle/)\n\n\nOver the past centuries, fossil fuels have played an essential role in the unprecedented development of the human civilization, but rapid fossil fuels combustion since the industrial revolution results in over 35 gigatonnes CO2 emission annually, which gradually disrupts the balance of the natural carbon cycle and causes serve climate issues including but not limited to the climate change, rising sea-levels, and decreasing food security.\n\n\n9.1.2 Blue carbon:\nBlue carbon is the term for carbon captured by the world’s ocean and coastal ecosystems. Sea grasses, mangroves, salt marshes, and other systems along our coast are very efficient in storing \\(CO_2\\). These areas also absorb and store carbon at a much faster rate than other areas, such as forests, and can continue to do so for millions of years.\n\n\n\nFigure: Blue carbon (Source: www.oceanservice.noaa.gov)\n\n\nMangroves, tidal marshes, and seagrasses have been recognized as blue carbon coastal ecosystems as they accommodate large carbon stocks, enable long-term carbon storage, have the capacity to control greenhouse gas emissions and possess the potential to reduce the rise in atmospheric CO2 levels.\n\n\n\nMangrove in Okinawa, Japan\n\n\n\n\n9.1.3 Effects of Changing the Carbon Cycle\n\nAll of this extra carbon needs to go somewhere. So far, land plants and the ocean have taken up about 55 percent of the extra carbon people have put into the atmosphere while about 45 percent has stayed in the atmosphere. Eventually, the land and oceans will take up most of the extra carbon dioxide, but as much as 20 percent may remain in the atmosphere for many thousands of years.\nThe changes in the carbon cycle impact each reservoir. Excess carbon in the atmosphere warms the planet. Excess carbon in the ocean makes the water more acidic, putting marine life in danger.\nHumans play a major role in the carbon cycle through activities such as the burning of fossil fuels or land development. As a result, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rapidly rising; it is already considerably greater than at any time in the last 3.6 million years.\n\n\n\n9.1.4 Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\nGHG emissions accounting is an important factor in the design and implementation of climate mitigation policy. As the world’s largest exporter of embodied emissions, in 2009, China had over one-fifth of its export-related emissions flow to the EU and the US, respectively: the two largest importers of embodied emissions in the world.\n\n\n\nFigure: GHG emissions embodied in the goods produced in one region and transported to another (Source: Chen et. al. 2018)",

    "text": "9.2 Nitrogen (\\(N\\))\n\nNitrogen is everywhere! In fact, \\(N_2\\) gas makes up about 78% of Earth’s atmosphere by volume. Nitrogen is a key component of the bodies of living organisms. Nitrogen doesn’t remain forever in the bodies of living organisms. Instead, it’s converted from organic nitrogen back into \\(N_2\\) gas by bacteria.\nHaving nitrogen around and being able to make use of it are two different things. We humans may not be able to fix nitrogen biologically, but we certainly do industrially! About 450 million metric tons of fixed nitrogen are made each year using a chemical method called the Haber-Bosch process, in which \\(N_2\\) is reacted with hydrogen (\\(H_2\\)) at high temperatures. Most of this fixed nitrogen goes to make fertilizers we use on our lawns, gardens, and agricultural fields.\nIn general, human activity releases nitrogen into the environment by two main means: combustion of fossil fuels and use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers in agriculture. Both processes increase levels of nitrogen-containing compounds in the atmosphere.\n\n\n9.2.1 Nitrogen cycle\nThe nitrogen cycle refers to the movement of nitrogen within and between the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and geosphere. The nitrogen cycle matters because nitrogen is an essential nutrient for sustaining life on Earth.\n\n\n\nFigure: Nitrogen cycle\n\n\n\nThe production and use of fertilizers for agricultural activities that increase the amount of nutrients in soil or water, especially nitrogen. These nutrients increase plant and algae growth. However, increased nutrient is not always a good thing.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Algae growth\n\n\n\nBurning of fossil fuels releases nitrous oxide (\\(N_2O\\)), a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels also releases nitrogen oxides (\\(NO_x\\)), sulfur dioxide (\\(SO_2\\)), and carbon dioxide (\\(CO_2\\)) that react with water vapor, oxygen, and other chemicals to form acid rain.\nIncreased precipitation can increase erosion and thus increase the transport of nitrogen (and other chemical nutrients) into soils, freshwater environments, and coastal waters.\nDeforestation, habitat loss, and erosion can reduce the nutrient levels in soils.\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Organic nitrogen fertilizer use in wineries of Australia\nAustralian organic wineries manage nitrogen naturally through cover crops (legumes like medic fix nitrogen), compost, and bio-dynamic practices, reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeguminous crops (such as soybeans, alfalfa, peanuts, beans, and clover) possess a unique ability to utilize nitrogen, often thriving in nitrogen-deficient soils through a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.3 The Haber-Bosch Process\nThe Haber–Bosch process, is the main industrial procedure for the production of ammonia. The German chemists Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch developed it in the first decade of the 20th century. The process converts atmospheric nitrogen (N2) to ammonia (NH3) by a reaction with hydrogen (H2). Before the development of the Haber process, it had been difficult to produce ammonia on an industrial scale.\nUses for Ammonia:\n\n88% of ammonia is used to make fertilizers\nAmmonia is oxidized to \\(NO_2\\) and \\(NO_3\\) for use in explosives\n\nReferences:\n\nChen, ZM., Ohshita, S., Lenzen, M. et al. Consumption-based greenhouse gas emissions accounting with capital stock change highlights dynamics of fast-developing countries.

The methods can be involved, for natural capital ranges over plants (they are tangible and alienable), pollinators (they are tangible and often non-alienable), the view from one’s sea-front home (it is intangible and alienable) and the global climate (it is intangible and non-alienable).\nValuation methods that involve estimating the use value of Nature by determining the productivity of its processes involve a blend of ecological and economic reasoning: The accounting value of a lake fishery can be approximated by the market value of catch over time.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Interaction Between the Capitals",

That is what we have been doing over millennia and is what economic development has come to mean among many people.\nThat was a legitimate formulation of economic development when our ecological footprint was less than the biosphere’s ability to supply goods and services to meet that demand at a sustainable rate.

    "text": "11.2 The nine planetary boundaries and their status\n\n11.2.1 Climate change:\nIncreased greenhouse gases and aerosols in Earth’s atmosphere trap heat that would otherwise escape into space. The climate change planetary boundary assesses the change in the ratio of incoming and outgoing energy of the Earth. More carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and more trapped radiation causes global temperatures to rise and alters climate patterns. This boundary is transgressed, and CO2 concentrations are rising.\nExample: The Keeling Curve is a graph of the annual variation and overall accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth’s atmosphere based on continuous measurements taken at the Mauna Loa Observatory on the island of Hawaii from 1958 to the present day. The curve is named for the scientist Charles David Keeling, who started the monitoring program and supervised it until his death in 2005.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeling’s measurements showed the first significant evidence of rapidly increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the atmosphere. According to Naomi Oreskes, Professor of History of Science at Harvard University, the Keeling curve is one of the most important scientific works of the 20th century. Many scientists credit the Keeling curve with first bringing the world’s attention to the current increase of CO2 in the atmosphere.\n\n\n11.2.2 Novel entities:\nTechnological developments introduce novel synthetic chemicals into the environment, mobilize materials in wholly new ways, modify the genetics of living organisms, and otherwise intervene in evolutionary processes and change the functioning of the Earth system. The amount of synthetic substances released into the environment without adequate safety testing places novel entities in the high-risk zone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.3 Stratospheric ozone depletion:\nOzone high in the atmosphere protects life on Earth from incoming ultraviolet radiation. The thinning of the ozone layer, primarily due to human-made chemicals, allows more harmful UV radiation to reach Earth’s surface. Total ozone is slowly recovering because of the international phasing-out of ozone-depleting substances since the late 1980s. Ozone depletion is therefore currently in the Safe Operating Space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.4 Atmospheric aerosol loading:\nChanges in airborne particles from human activities and natural sources influence the climate by altering temperature and precipitation patterns. Although large-scale air pollution already causes changes to monsoon systems, forest biomass and marine ecosystems, the global metric used in the planetary boundaries framework – interhemispheric difference in atmospheric aerosol loading – places this process just within the Safe Operating Space.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.5 Ocean acidification:\nThe acidity of ocean water increases (its pH decreases) as it absorbs atmospheric CO2. This process harms organisms that need calcium carbonate to make their shells or skeletons, impacting marine ecosystems, and it reduces the ocean’s efficiency in acting as a carbon sink. The 2025 Planetary Health Check showed that the Ocean Acidification boundary has been breached for the first time. Since the start of the industrial era, the ocean’s surface pH has fallen by around 0.1 units, a 30-40% increase in acidity, pushing marine ecosystems beyond safe limits and degrading the oceans’ ability to act as Earth’s stabiliser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.6 Modification of biogeochemical flows:\nNutrient elements like nitrogen and phosphorus are crucial for supporting life and maintaining ecosystems. Industrial and agricultural processes disrupt natural cycles and modify the nutrient balance for living organisms. This boundary is transgressed, because both the global phosphorus flow into the ocean and the industrial fixation of nitrogen (converting stable nitrogen from the atmosphere into bioreactive forms) have disrupted global biogeochemical flows.\n\n\n11.2.7 Freshwater change:\nThe alteration of freshwater cycles, including rivers and soil moisture, impacts natural functions such as carbon sequestration and biodiversity, and can lead to shifts in precipitation levels. Human-induced disturbances of both blue water (e.g. rivers and lakes) and green water (i.e. soil moisture) have exceeded the planetary boundary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.8 Land system change:\nThe transformation of natural landscapes, such as through deforestation and urbanization, disrupts habitats and biodiversity and diminishes ecological functions like carbon sequestration and moisture recycling. Globally, the remaining forest areas in tropical, boreal, and temperate biomes have fallen below safe levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.2.9 Biosphere integrity:\nThe diversity, extent, and health of living organisms and ecosystems affects the state of the planet by co-regulating the energy balance and chemical cycles on Earth. Disrupting biodiversity threatens this co-regulation and dynamic stability. Both the loss of genetic diversity and the decline in the functional integrity of the biosphere are outside safe levels.",

    "text": "11.4 Economic intervention to improve the condition\n\n11.4.1 A carbon tax\n\nA carbon tax works by taxing fossil fuels in proportion to carbon content. Per unit of energy, coal is taxed more heavily than oil and natural gas, while non-fossil-fuel sources of energy are untaxed. Burning fuel containing a given quantity of carbon leads predictably and unavoidably to a given amount of carbon dioxide emissions, so that a tax on the carbon content of fuels is almost equivalent to taxing carbon dioxide emissions themselves. With the exception of carbon-capture-and-storage technologies that may shortly become available for power stations no viable end-of-pipe cleaning technologies for carbon dioxide emissions are currently available.\nTaxing carbon would encourage energy users to substitute away from high-carbon energy sources towards fuels with lower emissions per unit of energy. If levied on the fuels used by power stations, for example, a carbon tax would encourage a shift away from power generation using coal towards oil and gas, and even more strongly towards untaxed renewables (wind and wave power), and towards nuclear energy.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Carbon tax\n\n\n\nSuppose that a carbon tax T is added into the price. For a given quantity, the supplier’s price will be the old price plus the amount of the tax, and the supply curve will shift up to S*. The new equilibrium is at point B, the quantity is the target Q1, and the price will increase to P1.\n\n\n\n11.4.2 Carbon tax in Japan\nIn October 2012, Japan introduced Carbon tax. Japan is one of the first Asian countries to implement a carbon tax. With a tax rate of JPY289/ t-CO2 ($2.65), Japan is set to attain 26% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030.\n\nJapan, a signatory to the 2015 Paris Agreement, has been active in implementing measures to reduce its carbon emissions. In 2012 Japan passed a carbon tax of JPY 2,89/ t-Co2 ($2.65) which led to carbon emissions lower than 1990s levels (Ministry of Environment, 2019).\n\nThe carbon tax is an additional tax over and above the existing Oil and Coal Tax, which covers oil, natural gas and coal (electricity excluded). The tax rates for the three types of energy are different. Natural gas is taxed the highest rate, followed by fossil fuel, and coal. To mitigate the impact on the industry, Japan adopted a three-stage tax increase.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, this target is substantially lower than one recommended by environmental scientists, 76% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 (UNFCCC, 2019).",

    "text": "12.3 From stagnation to sustained growth\n\nDid you know that economic stagnation, not growth, was the norm throughout most of human history?\n\nOver the past 200 years, the world has witnessed more economic growth than ever before. Its foundation is the constant flow of technological innovation; sustained economic growth occurs when new technologies replace old ones as part of the process known as creative destruction. This year’s Laureates in Economic Sciences explain, using different methods, why this development was possible and what is necessary for continued growth.\nTechnology advances rapidly and affects us all, with new products and production methods replacing old ones in a never-ending cycle. This is the basis for sustained economic growth, which results in a better standard of living, health and quality of life for people around the globe.\nHowever, this was not always the case. Quite the opposite – stagnation was the norm throughout most of human history. Despite important discoveries now and again, which sometimes led to improved living conditions and higher incomes, growth always eventually leveled off.\n\n12.3.1 What Is Stagnation?\nEconomic stagnation is a period characterized by slow or no growth, often with high unemployment, affecting both macroeconomic scales and specific sectors. Typically marked by a GDP growth rate of less than 2-3%.\nKey Characteristics and Causes:\n\nLow Growth & Employment: GDP growth is consistently minimal or non-existent, frequently accompanied by high unemployment rates.\nStagnant Wages: Income levels for workers fail to rise, limiting consumer purchasing power and demand.\nLack of Investment/Innovation: Businesses may reduce investment, and innovation slows down, often caused by structural issues or an aging workforce.\n\n\n\n12.3.2 The forces behind progress\n2025 economic sciences laureates Joel Mokyr and Philippe Aghion reveal the forces behind progress, and discover how ideas, innovation and a touch of creative destruction sparked the greatest boom in human history.\n\n\n12.3.3 Economic growth cannot be taken for granted\n“The laureates’ work shows that economic growth cannot be taken for granted. We must uphold the mechanisms that underly creative destruction, so that we do not fall back into stagnation,” says John Hassler, Chair of the Committee for the prize in economic sciences.\nTo illustrate, consider their metaphorical “innovation ladder.” Firms climb this ladder by investing in R&D, while others fall off as new technologies render them obsolete. The process is painful but necessary: without turnover, there is stagnation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3.4 The new normal\nEconomists measure economic growth by calculating increases in gross domestic product (GDP) but, actually, it involves much more than just money. New medicines, safer cars, better food, more efficient ways of heating and lighting our homes, the internet and increased opportunities for communication with other people over greater distances – these are just a few of the things included in growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, as we have said, economic growth based on technological development was not the historical norm – quite the opposite. One example of this is the trend in Sweden and Britain from the early 14th century to the start of the 18th century. Income sometimes rose and sometimes fell but, overall, there was almost indiscernible growth, despite important innovation occurring.\nThese discoveries thus had no noticeable effect on long-run economic growth. According to Mokyr, this is because the new ideas did not continue to evolve or lead to the flow of improvements and new applications that we now take for granted, as a natural consequence of major technological and scientific advancements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstead, when we look at economic growth in Britain and Sweden from the start of the 19th century to the present day, we see something entirely different. Apart from easily identifiable episodes such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and other crises, growth – rather than stagnation – has become the new normal. A similar pattern, with sustained annual growth of almost two per cent, arose in many industrialised nations after the early 19th century. It may not sound like much, but sustained growth at that level means a doubling of income over a person’s working life. Eventually, this has a revolutionary effect on the world and on people’s quality of life.\n\n\n12.3.5 Useful knowledge\nSo – what creates this sustained economic growth? This year’s laureates used different methods to answer this question. Through his research in economic history, Joel Mokyr has demonstrated that a continual flow of useful knowledge is necessary. This useful knowledge has two parts: the first is what Mokyr refers to as propositional knowledge, a systematic description of regularities in the natural world that demonstrate why something works; the second is prescriptive knowledge, such as practical instructions, drawings or recipes that describe what is necessary for something to work. Mokyr shows that prior to the Industrial Revolution, technological innovation was primarily based on prescriptive knowledge. People knew that something worked, but not why. Propositional knowledge, such as in mathematics and natural philosophy, was developed without reference to prescriptive knowledge, which made it difficult, even impossible, to build upon existing knowledge. Attempted innovations were often haphazard or had approaches that someone with adequate propositional knowledge would have understood were futile – such as building a perpetual motion machine or using alchemy to make gold.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 16th and 17th centuries witnessed the Scientific Revolution as part of the Enlightenment. Scientists began to insist upon precise measurement methods, controlled experiments, and that results should be reproducible, leading to improved feedback between propositional and prescriptive knowledge. This increased the accumulation of useful knowledge that could be utilised in the production of goods and ser- vices. Typical examples include how the steam engine was improved thanks to contemporaneous insights into atmospheric pressure and vacuums, and advances in steel production due to the understanding of how oxygen reduces the carbon content of molten pig iron. Gains in useful knowledge facilitated the improvement of existing inventions and provided them with new areas of use.\n\nThe Second Industrial Revolution, also known as the Technological Revolution, was a phase of rapid scientific discovery, standardization, mass production and industrialization from the late 19th century into the early 20th century.\n\n\n\n12.3.6 From theory to practice\nHowever, if new ideas are to be realized, practical, technical and, not least, commercial knowledge are all necessary. Without these, even the most brilliant ideas will remain on the drawing board, such as Leonardo da Vinci’s helicopter designs. Mokyr stressed that sustained growth first occurred in Britain because it was home to many skilled artisans and engineers. They were able to understand designs and transform ideas into commercial products, and this was vital in achieving sustained growth. Reduced resistance to change\nAnother factor that Mokyr claims is necessary for sustained growth is that society is open to change. Growth based upon technological change not only creates winners, it also creates losers. New inven- tions replace old technologies and can destroy existing structures and ways of working. He also showed that this is why new technology is often met with resistance from established interest groups who feel their privileges are threatened.\nThe Enlightenment brought a generally increased acceptance of change. New institutions, such as the British Parliament, did not provide the same opportunities for those with privilege to block change. Instead, representatives from interest groups had the opportunity to gather and reach mutually benefi- cial compromises. These changes to societal institutions removed a major barrier to sustained growth.\nPropositional knowledge can sometimes also contribute to reducing resistance to new ideas. In the 19th century, Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis realised that maternal mortality rates dropped drastically if physicians and other staff washed their hands. If he had known why and been able to prove the existence of dangerous bacteria that are killed by handwashing, his ideas may have had an earlier impact.\n\n\n12.3.7 Growth – a transformative process\nJoel Mokyr used historical observations to identify the factors necessary for sustained growth. Instead, inspired by modern data, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt constructed a mathemati- cal economic model that shows how technological advancement leads to sustained growth. These approaches are different, but fundamentally they deal with the same questions and phenomena. As we have seen above, economic growth in industrialised nations such as Britain and Sweden has been remarkably stable. However, below the surface, the reality is anything but stable. In the US, for example, over ten per cent of all companies go out of business every year, and just as many are started. Among the remaining businesses, a large number of jobs are created or disappear every year; even if these figures are not as high in other countries, the pattern is the same.\nAghion and Howitt realised that this transformative process of creative destruction, in which companies and jobs continually disappear and are replaced, is at the heart of the process that leads to sustained growth. A company that has an idea for a better product or a more efficient means of production can outcompete others to become the market leader. However, as soon as this happens, it creates an incentive for other companies to further improve the product or production method and so climb to the top of the ladder.\n\n\n12.3.8 A groundbreaking model\nA simplified description of some of the model’s important mechanisms would be that an economy includes companies with the best and most advanced technology; when these take out patents on their products they can be paid more than their production costs and thus profit from a monopoly. These are the companies that have moved to the top of the ladder. A patent offers protection from compe- tition, but not from another company making a new patentable innovation. If the new product or production process is good enough, it can outcompete the old one and further climb the ladder.\nThe potential to profit from a monopoly, even temporarily, creates incentives for companies to invest in research and development (R&D). The longer a company believes it can remain at the top of the ladder, the stronger the incentives, and the greater the investment in R&D. However, more R&D will lead to the average time to innovation decreasing, and the company at the top being pushed off the ladder. In the economy, a balance arises between these forces that decide how much is invested in R&D, thus also deciding the speed of creative destruction and economic growth.\nMoney for investment in R&D originates in households’ savings. How much they save depends on the interest rate which, in turn, is affected by the growth rate of the economy. Production, R&D, the financial markets and household savings are therefore linked and cannot be analysed in isolation. Economists call a model in which different markets are in balance a macroeconomic model that has general equilibrium. The model that Aghion and Howitt presented in their 1992 paper was the first macroeconomic model for creative destruction to have general equilibrium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.3.9 Welfare effects\nAghion and Howitt’s model can be used to analyse whether there is an optimal volume of R&D, and thus economic growth, if the market has free reign and there is no political interference. Previous models, which did not analyse the economy as a whole, could not answer that question. It turned out that the answer was far from simple, because two mechanisms pull in different directions. The first mechanism is based upon companies that invest in R&D understanding that their current profits from an innovation will not continue forever. Sooner or later, another company will launch a better product. From the perspective of society, however, the value of the old innovation does not disappear, because the new one builds upon the old knowledge. Outcompeted innovations thus have a greater value for society than for the companies that develop them, which makes the private incentives for R&D smaller than the gains to society as a whole. Society can therefore benefit from subsidising R&D.\nThe second mechanism looks at how, when one company succeeds in pushing another from the top of the ladder, the new company makes a profit while the old company’s profit disappears. The latter is often called “business stealing”, although it is of course not stealing in the legal sense. Therefore, even if the new innovation is only slightly better than the old one, profits may be significant and larger than the socioeconomic gains. Therefore, from a socioeconomic perspective, investments in R&D can be too large; technological development can be too rapid and growth too high. This cre- ates arguments against society subsidising R&D.\nWhich of these two forces dominates depends on a range of factors, which vary from market to market and time to time. Aghion and Howitt’s theory is useful for the understanding of which measures will be most effective and the extent to which society needs to support R&D.\n\n\n12.3.10 Research led to more research\nThe model that Aghion and Howitt constructed in 1992 has led to new research, including the study of levels of market concentration, which involves the number of companies that compete with each other. The researchers’ theory shows that concentrations that are both too high and too low are bad for the innovation process. Despite promising advances in technology, growth has fallen in recent decades. One explanation for this, based on Aghion and Howitt’s model, is that some companies have become too dominant. More forceful policies that aim to counteract too much market domi- nance may be necessary.\nAnother important lesson is that innovation creates winners and losers. This not only applies to companies, but also to their employees. High growth requires a lot of creative destruction, which means that more jobs disappear and there is potentially high unemployment. Therefore, it is important to support people who are affected while making it easy for them to move to more productive workplaces. Protecting workers but not jobs, for example through a system that is sometimes called flexicurity, may be the right solution.\nThe laureates also demonstrate the importance of society creating conditions conducive to skilled innovators and entrepreneurs. Social mobility, where your profession is not decided by your parents’ identity, is thus important for growth.\n\n\n12.3.11 Tools for future societies\nMokyr’s, Aghion’s and Howitt’s research helps us to understand contemporary trends and how we can deal with important problems. For example, Mokyr’s work shows that AI could reinforce the feedback between propositional and prescriptive knowledge, and increase the rate at which useful knowledge is accumulated.\nIt is apparent that, in the long run, sustained growth does not only have positive consequences for human wellbeing. First, sustained growth is not synonymous with sustainable growth. Innovations can have significant negative side effects. Mokyr argues that such negative effects sometimes initiate processes that uncover solutions to problems, making technological development a self-correcting process. Clearly, however, this often requires well-designed policies, such as in the areas of climate change, pollution, antibiotic resistance, increasing inequality and the unsustainable use of natural resources.\nIn conclusion, and perhaps most importantly, the laureates have taught us that sustained growth cannot be taken for granted. Economic stagnation, not growth, has been the norm for most of human history. Their work shows that we must be aware of, and counteract, threats to continued growth. These threats may come from a few companies being allowed to dominate the market, restrictions on academic freedom, expanding knowledge at regional rather than global levels, and blockades from potentially disadvantaged groups. If we fail to respond to these threats, the machine that has given us sustained growth, creative destruction, may cease working – and we would once again need to become accustomed to stagnation. We can avoid this if we heed the laureates’ vital insights.",

    "text": "13.2 What is institution\nAn institution is a system of social factors that conjointly generate a regularity of behavior. For instance; government, university, bank etc.\n\n13.2.1 How institutions are formed and affect prosperity\nWhen Europeans colonized large parts of the globe, the institutions in those societies changed. This was sometimes dramatic, but did not occur in the same way everywhere.\n\nIn some places the aim was to exploit the indigenous population and extract resources for the colonizers’ benefit.\nIn others, the colonizers formed inclusive political and economic systems for the long-term benefit of European migrants.\n\n\nExamples of extractive colonies include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Peru, Bolivia, India, and much of Sub-Saharan Africa. In these places, European colonizers established institutions designed to extract natural resources and labor from indigenous populations. These institutions often relied on forced labor, heavy taxation, and limited protection of property rights for the majority of the population. Political power was highly concentrated, and economic opportunities were restricted to a small elite.\nExamples of inclusive colonies include the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. In these settler colonies, Europeans established institutions that protected private property, enforced the rule of law, and allowed broad participation in economic and political activities. These institutions encouraged investment, innovation, and human capital accumulation.\n\nAccording to Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson, the key determinant of these differences was settler mortality. In regions where European settlers faced high mortality due to disease, they were unlikely to settle permanently and instead set up extractive institutions. In regions with low settler mortality, Europeans settled in large numbers and created inclusive institutions resembling those in Europe.\nThe long-run economic outcomes of these two groups of countries differ sharply. Countries with a history of inclusive institutions now have much higher levels of income per capita, stronger states, and more stable economic growth. In contrast, countries with a history of extractive institutions tend to exhibit lower income levels, weaker property rights, greater inequality, and persistent political instability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModern European colonialism began in the 15th century, when Spain and Portugal established overseas empires. By the early 20th century, it had peaked: the United Kingdom and France dominated, and nearly 100 modern-day countries were under European control, mostly in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean.\nAs the chart shows, this changed rapidly after World War II. A wave of decolonization spread across the world, especially in the 1950s and 1960s. Colonies became independent countries, formed their own governments, joined international institutions, and started having their own voice in global decisions.\nColonial expansion by Europeans into Africa, Asia, Australia, the Caribbean and Pacific Islands, and North and South America profoundly shaped minority experiences in these areas of the world. Europeans were eager to move to new territories opened to them by exploration to seek freedom and economic opportunities.\nThe laureates have shown that one explanation for differences in countries’ prosperity is the societal institutions that were introduced during colonization. Inclusive institutions were often introduced in countries that were poor when they were colonized, over time resulting in a generally prosperous population. This is an important reason for why former colonies that were once rich are now poor, and viceversa.\nSome countries become trapped in a situation with extractive institutions and low economic growth. The introduction of inclusive institutions would create long-term benefits for everyone, but extractive institutions provide short-term gains for the people in power. As long as the political system guarantees they will remain in control, no one will trust their promises of future economic reforms. According to the laureates, this is why no improvement occurs.\n\n\n\n13.2.2 Economic institutions matter for economic growth\n\nEconomic institutions shape the incentives of key economic actors in society, in particular, they influence investments in physical and human capital and technology, and the organization of production.\nAlthough cultural and geographical factors may also matter for economic performance, differences in economic institutions are the major source of cross-country differences in economic growth and prosperity.\nEconomic institutions not only determine the aggregate economic growth potential of the economy, but also an array of economic outcomes, including the distribution of resources in the future (i.e., the distribution of wealth, of physical capital or human capital).\nIn other words, they influence not only the size of the aggregate pie, but how this pie is divided among different groups and individuals in society. We summarize these ideas schematically as (where the subscript t refers to current period and t+1 to the future):\n\n\\[ Economic \\ Institutions =&gt; \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}\nEconomic \\ performance_t & \\\\\nDistribution \\ of \\ resources_{t+1} &\n\\end{array} \\right. \\]\n\n\n13.2.3 Three fundamental causes of income differences\n\n13.2.3.1 Economic institutions\nAt its core, the hypothesis that differences in economic institutions are the fundamental cause of different patterns of economic growth is based on the notion that it is the way that humans themselves decide to organize their societies that determines whether or not they prosper. Some ways of organizing societies encourage people to innovate, to take risks, to save for the future, to find better ways of doing things, to learn and educate themselves, solve problems of collective action and provide public goods. Others do not.\n\nInstitutions shape the incentives and opportunities.\nlog GDP per capita and World Bank’s rule of law index\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Correlation between institutions and GDP\n\n\n\nThe “Rule of Law Index” evaluates 142 countries and jurisdictions around the world. For the seventh year in a row, the rule of law has declined in most countries.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Rules and Law Index in 2024\n\n\nYou can find the recent Rules and Law Index from the following link: https://worldjusticeproject.org/rule-of-law-index/global\n\n13.2.3.1.1 Institutions are endogenous\n\nCorrelation between institutions and prosperity does not imply a causal effect from institutions\nPerhaps rich countries can “afford” better institutions, or their populations “demand” such institutions\nOr omitted factors influence both institutions and prosperity\n\n\n\n13.2.3.1.2 European colonial history\n\nColonialism is one of the most formative institutional events of the millennium\nIt also provides a laboratory for understanding the effects of institutions\nEuropeans set up—and led to the development of—very different sets of institutions across the colonial empire\nWe see in the colonial world the whole range of institutions, from highly extractive to broadly inclusive ones. But why?\nWe need a theory\n\n\n\n13.2.3.1.3 How institutions matter\n\nPolitical institutions and the distribution of resources (capital, land, human capital) as state variables.\nEconomic institutions shape incentives for investment, innovation and economic participation.\nInstitutional persistence and institutional change caused by the interplay of these dynamics\n\n\n\n\n13.2.3.2 Geography\nWhile institutional theories emphasize the importance of man-made factors shaping incentives, an alternative is to focus on the role of “nature”, that is, on the physical and geographical environment. In the context of understanding cross-country differences in economic performance, this approach emphasizes differences in geography, climate and ecology that determine both the preferences and the opportunity set of individual economic agents in different societies. We refer to this broad approach as the “geography hypothesis”. There are at least three main versions of the geography hypothesis, each emphasizing a different mechanism for how geography affects prosperity.\n\nFirst, climate may be an important determinant of work effort, incentives, or even productivity.\nSecond, geography may determine the technology available to a society, especially in agriculture.\nThe third variant of the geography hypothesis, especially popular over the past decade, links poverty in many areas of the world to their “disease burden”, emphasizing that: “The burden of infectious disease is similarly higher in the tropics than in the temperate zones”\n\n\n\n13.2.3.3 Culture\nThe final fundamental explanation for economic growth emphasizes the idea that different societies (or perhaps different races or ethnic groups) have different cultures, because of different shared experiences or different religions. Culture is viewed as a key determinant of the values, preferences and beliefs of individuals and societies and, the argument goes, these differences play a key role in shaping economic performance.\n\n\n\n13.2.4 Institutions matter\nWe now argue that there is convincing empirical support for the hypothesis that differences in economic institutions, rather than geography or culture, cause differences in incomes per-capita. Why do institutions matter?\n\nIncentives: Institutions determine economic rewards and risks.\nPolitical Power: Those in power influence institutions to benefit themselves.\nLong-term Development: Good institutions promote investment, innovation, and efficiency.\n\nAcemoglu et al 2019 suggests that, on average, democratizations increase GDP per capita by about 20 percent in the long run (Figure below). However, that does not mean that one can just introduce elections and hope to get the observed average boost-effect. State capacity – shaped by the incentives, beliefs and professional norms shared among state personnel - is crucial to explain differences in institutional performance and policy effectiveness.\n\n\n\nFigure: GDP Per Capita before and after Democratization\n\n\n\n13.2.4.1 The Korean Experiment\n\nNatural experiment: Korea was divided into North and South after WWII.\n\nThe division of Korea into North and South Korea after World War II is often considered a “natural experiment” by social scientists, as it provides a unique opportunity to study how two populations with largely similar cultural backgrounds can develop vastly different economic and political systems due to the contrasting political ideologies imposed on them by the occupying powers, the US and the Soviet Union, following the Cold War division along the 38th parallel.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2021 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Prof David Card (UC Berkeley), Prof Joshua D. Angrist (MIT), and Prof Guido W. Imbens (Stanford) for pioneering “natural experiments” to help answer important real-world questions. They have provided us with new insights about the natural experiments. Their approach has spread to other fields and revolutionized empirical research.\nMany of the big questions in the social sciences deal with cause and effect. How does immigration affect pay and employment levels? How does a longer education affect someone’s future income? These questions are difficult to answer because we have nothing to use as a comparison.\nHowever, this year’s Laureates have shown that it is possible to answer these and similar questions using natural experiments.\n\n\n\n\nThe 2021 economic sciences laureates\n\n\n\n14.0.1 Experiment in physical science vs. experiment in economics\nThe key difference between an experiment in economics and an experiment in physical science lies in the subject matter and the level of control over variables, with physics experiments generally having more control over variables due to studying inanimate objects, while economics experiments deal with human behavior, making it harder to isolate and manipulate factors, often requiring more reliance on observation and controlled settings to test economic theories.\n\n\n\nFigure: Experiment in Physical Science\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Experiment in Economics\n\n\n\n\n14.0.2 Causality vs. correlation\n\nCorrelation: Correlation is a statistical measure (expressed as a number) that describes the size and direction of a relationship between two or more variables. A correlation between variables, however, does not automatically mean that the change in one variable is the cause of the change in the values of the other variable.\nCausality: Causation indicates that one event is the result of the occurrence of the other event; i.e. there is a causal relationship between the two events. This is also referred to as cause and effect.\nThe difference between causality and correlation. When the sun makes ice cream melt and people get sunburned, we have causality. For the summer period, a researcher can measure a statistical correlation between the number of melted ice creams and the number of sunburned people. But despite such mathematical correlation, it is not the ice cream that makes people sunburnt, or vice versa. Instead, it is a case of correlation without causality.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.0.3 Make a good decision:\n\nIf we are to make good decisions, we must understand the consequences of our choices. This applies to individuals as well as public policy makers: young people who are making educational choices want to know how these affect their future income; politicians considering a range of reforms want to know how these affect employment and income distribution, for example. However, answering broad questions about cause and effect is not easy, because we will never know what would have happened if we had made a different choice.\nMany of the big questions in the social sciences deal with cause and effect. How does immigration affect pay and employment levels? How does a longer education affect someone’s future income? These questions are difficult to answer because we have nothing to use as a comparison. We do not know what would have happened if there had been less immigration or if that person had not continued studying.\nHowever, this year’s Laureates have shown that it is possible to answer these and similar questions using natural experiments. The key is to use situations in which chance events or policy changes result in groups of people being treated differently, in a way that resembles clinical trials in medicine.\n\n\n\n14.0.4 Treatment/Experimental and Control/Placebo Groups\nThere are two groups in the experiment, and they are identical except that one receives a treatment while the other does not. The group that receives the treatment in an experiment is called the treatment/experimental group, while the group that does not receive the treatment is called the control group. The control group provides a baseline that lets us see if the treatment has an effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.0.4.1 Example: Vitamin B Energy Study\nResearchers want to know if adults who consume a drink that is high in vitamin B-12 have increased energy. They obtain a representative sample of adults. All participants are given a drink that they are told to consume every morning. They are not told what is in the drink. Half are given a drink that is high in vitamin B-12 while the other half are given a drink that tastes the same but contains no vitamin B-12.\nThe participants who received the drink with no vitamin B-12 are the placebo group. The purpose of the placebo group in this study is to make the two groups equivalent except for the presence of the vitamin B-12. By comparing these two groups, the researchers will be able to determine what impact the vitamin B-12 had on the response variable. We could also say that this served as a control group because this group did not receive any active ingredients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.0.5 First example of a natural experiment\n\nLet us use a concrete example to illustrate how a natural experiment works. One question that is relevant to both society and to young people considering their future, is how much more you would earn if you chose to study longer. An initial attempt to answer this question could involve looking at data on how people’s earnings relate to their education. In every conceivable context, people with more years of education have higher incomes. For example, for men born in the US during the 1930s, earnings were, on average, seven per cent higher for those with one additional year of education.\nSo, can we conclude that an extra year of education adds an extra seven per cent on your income? The answer to this question is no – people who choose a long education differ in many ways from those who choose a short education. For example, some people may be talented at studying and at working. These people are likely to continue studying, but they would still probably have had a high income even if they hadn’t. It may also be the case that only people who expect education to pay off choose to study longer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, how can we use a natural experiment to examine whether additional years of education affect future income? Joshua Angrist and his colleague Alan Krueger (now deceased) showed how this could be done in a landmark article. In the US, children can leave school when they turn 16 or 17, depending on the state where they go to school. Because all children who are born in a particular calendar year start school on the same date, children who are born early in the year can leave school sooner than children born later in the year. When Angrist and Krueger compared people born in the first and fourth quarters of the year, they saw that the first group had, on average, spent less time in education. People born in the first quarter also had lower incomes than those born in the fourth quarter. As adults they thus had both less education and lower incomes than those born late in the year.\n\n\nQuarter 1: January, February and March\nQuarter 2: April, May and June\nQuarter 3: July, August and September\nQuarter 4: October, November and December\n\n\nBecause chance decides exactly when a person is born, Angrist and Krueger were able to use this natural experiment to establish a causal relationship showing that more education leads to higher earnings: the effect of an additional year of education on income was nine per cent. It was surprising that this effect was stronger than the association between education and income, which amounted to seven per cent. If ambitious and intelligent people have both high levels of education and high incomes (regardless of education) the result should have been the opposite; the correlation should have been stronger than the causal relationship. This observation raised new questions about how to interpret the results of natural experiments – questions that were later answered by Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens.\n\n\n14.0.5.1 People born late in the year have more years of education and higher incomes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt would be easy to believe that situations which enable natural experiments are very unusual, especially those that can be used to answer important questions. Research conducted over the past 30 years has shown that this is not the case: natural experiments occur frequently. For example, they may arise due to policy changes in some regions of a country, admission cut-offs in higher education, or income thresholds in tax and benefit systems, which mean that some individuals are exposed to an intervention while other, similar, individuals are not. There is thus unintended randomness that divides people into control and treatment groups, providing researchers with opportunities for uncovering causal relationships.\n\n\n\n\n14.0.6 Second example of a natural experiment\n\nIn the early 1990s, the conventional wisdom among economists was that higher minimum wages lead to lower employment because they increase wage costs for businesses. However, the evidence supporting this conclusion was not fully convincing; there were indeed many studies that indicated a negative correlation between minimum wages and employment, but did this really mean that higher minimum wages led to higher unemployment?\n\n\n14.0.6.1 The effect of increasing the minimum wage\n\nTo investigate how increased minimum wages affect employment, Card and Krueger used a natural experiment. In the early 1990s, the minimum hourly wage in New Jersey was raised from 4.25 dollars to 5.05 dollars. Just studying what happened in New Jersey after this increase does not give a reliable answer to the question, as numerous other factors can influence how employment levels change over time. As with randomized experiments, a control group was needed, i.e., a group where wages didn’t change but all the other factors were the same.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCard and Krueger noted that there was no increase in neighbouring Pennsylvania. Of course, there were differences between the two states, but it is likely that the labor markets would evolve similarly close to the border. So, they studied the effects on employment in two neighboring areas – New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania – which have a similar labor market, but where the minimum wage was increased on one side of the border but not the other. There was no apparent reason to believe that any factor (such as the economic situation) apart from the increase in the minimum wage would affect employment trends differently on either side of the border. Thus, if a change in the number of employees was observed in New Jersey, and this differed from any change on the other side of the border, there was good reason to interpret this as an effect of the increase in the minimum wage.\nCard and Krueger focused on employment in fast-food restaurants, an industry where pay is low and minimum wages matter. Contrary to previous research, they found that an increase in the minimum wage had no effect on the number of employees. David Card arrived at the same conclusion in a couple of studies in the early 1990s. This pioneering research has led to a large number of follow- up studies. The overall conclusion is that the negative effects of increasing the minimum wage are small, and significantly smaller than was believed 30 years ago.\nThe work conducted by Card at the beginning of the 1990s also led to new research, which attempted to explain the absence of negative effects on employment. One possible explanation is that companies can transfer increased costs to consumers in the form of higher prices, without significant reductions in demand. Another explanation is that companies that dominate their local labor market can keep wages low; an increased minimum wage thus means that more people want to work, leading to increased employment. When companies have such power over the market, we cannot determine in advance how employment will be affected by changes to the minimum wage. The many studies inspired by Card and Krueger’s work have considerably improved our understanding of the labor market.\n\nReferences:\n\nNobel Prize Lecture by David Card, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens.",

    "text": "The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has decided to award the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2019 to Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer.\n“For their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the last two decades, people’s living standards have noticeably improved almost everywhere in the world. Economic wellbeing (measured as GDP per capita) doubled in the poorest countries between 1995 and 2018. Child mortality has halved relative to 1995, and the proportion of children attending school has increased from 56 to 80 per cent.\nDespite this progress, gigantic challenges remain. Over 700 million people still subsist on extremely low incomes. Every year, five million children still die before their fifth birthday, often from diseases that could be prevented or cured with relatively cheap and simple treatments. Half of the world’s children still leave school without basic literacy and numeracy skills.\n\n\n15.0.1 A new approach to alleviating global poverty\nIn order to combat global poverty, we must identify the most effective forms of action. This year’s Laureates have shown how the problem of global poverty can be tackled by breaking it down into a number of smaller – but more precise – questions at individual or group levels. They then answer each of these using a specially designed field experiment. Over just twenty years, this approach has completely reshaped research in the field known as development economics. This new research is now delivering a steady flow of concrete results, helping to alleviate the problems of global poverty.\nThere has long been an awareness of the huge differences in average productivity between rich and poor countries. However, as Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo have noted, productivity differs greatly, not only between rich and poor countries but also within poor countries. Some individuals or companies use the latest technology, while others (which produce similar goods or services) use outdated means of production. The low average productivity is thus largely due to some individuals and companies falling behind. Does this reflect a lack of credit, poorly designed policies, or that people find it difficult to make entirely rational investment decisions? The research approach designed by this year’s Laureates deals with exactly these types of questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.0.2 Early field experiments in schools\nThe Laureates’ very first studies examined how to deal with problems relating to education. Which interventions increase educational outcomes at the lowest cost? In low-income countries, textbooks are scarce and children often go to school hungry. Would pupils’ results improve if they had access to more textbooks? Or would giving them free school meals be more effective? In the mid-1990s, Michael Kremer and his colleagues decided to move part of their research from their universities in the north-eastern US to rural western Kenya in order to answer these kinds of questions. They performed a number of field experiments in partnership with a local non-governmental organisation (NGO).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy did the researchers choose to use field experiments? Well, if you want to examine the effect of having more textbooks on pupils’ learning outcomes, for example, simply comparing schools with different access to textbooks is not a viable approach. The schools could differ in many ways: wealthier families usually buy more books for their children, grades are probably better in schools where fewer children are really poor, and so on. One way of circumventing these difficulties is to ensure that the schools being compared have the same average characteristics. This can be achieved by letting chance decide which schools are placed in which group for comparison – an old insight that underlies the long tradition of experimentation in the natural sciences and medicine. In contrast to traditional clinical trials, the Laureates have used field experiments in which they study how individuals behave in their everyday environments.\n\n\n15.0.3 Concrete results\nBelow, we provide a few examples of specific conclusions drawn from the type of research initiated by the Laureates, with the emphasis on their own studies.\n\n15.0.3.1 Education\nWe now have a clear perspective on the core problems in many poor country’s schools. Curricula and teaching do not correspond to pupils’ needs. There is a high level of absenteeism among teachers and educational institutions are generally weak. The above mentioned study by Banerjee, Duflo, et al. showed that targeted support for weak pupils had strong positive effects, even in the medium term. This study was the start of an interactive process, in which new research results went hand in hand with increasingly large-scale programmes to support pupils. These programmes have now reached more than 100,000 Indian schools. Other field experiments investigated the lack of clear incentives and accountability for teachers, which was reflected in a high level of absenteeism. One way of boosting the teachers’ motivation was to employ them on short-term contracts that could be extended if they had good results. Duflo, Kremer et al. compared the effects of employing teachers on these terms with lowering the pupil-teacher ratio by having fewer pupils per permanently employed teacher. They found that pupils who had teachers on short-term contracts had significantly better test results, but that having fewer pupils per permanently employed teacher had no significant effects. Overall, this new, experiment-based research on education in low-income countries shows that additional resources are, in general, of limited value. However, educational reforms that adapt teaching to pupils’ needs are of great value. Improving school governance and demanding responsibility from teachers who are not doing their job are also cost-effective measures.\n\nWORMS: IDENTIFYING IMPACTS ON EDUCATION AND HEALTH IN THE PRESENCE OF TREATMENT EXTERNALITIES BY E DWARD M IGUEL AND M ICHAEL K REMER\n\nIntestinal helminths—including hookworm, roundworm, whipworm, and schistoso-miasis—infect more than one-quarter of the world’s population. Studies in which medical treatment is randomized at the individual level potentially doubly underestimate the beneﬁts of treatment, missing externality beneﬁts to the comparison group from reduced disease transmission, and therefore also underestimating beneﬁts for the treatment group. We evaluate a Kenyan project in which school-based mass treatment with deworming drugs was randomly phased into schools, rather than to individuals, allowing estimation of overall program effects. The program reduced school absenteeism in treatment schools by one-quarter, and was far cheaper than alternative ways of boosting school participation. Deworming substantially improved health and school participation among untreated children in both treatment schools and neighboring schools,and these externalities are large enough to justify fully subsidizing treatment. Yet we do not ﬁnd evidence that deworming improved academic test scores.\nKEYWORDS : Health, education, Africa, externalities, randomized evaluation, worms.\n\n\n15.0.3.2 Health\nOne important issue is whether medicine and healthcare should be charged for and, if so, what they should cost. A field experiment by Kremer and co-author investigated how the demand for deworming pills for parasitic infections was affected by price. They found that 75 per cent of parents gave their children these pills when the medicine was free, compared to 18 per cent when they cost less than a US dollar, which is still heavily subsidised. Subsequently, many similar experiments have found the same thing: poor people are extremely price-sensitive regarding investments in preventive healthcare Low service quality is another explanation why poor families invest so little in preventive measures. One example is that staff at the health centres that are responsible for vaccinations are often absent from work. Banerjee, Duflo et al. investigated whether mobile vaccination clinics – where the care staff were always on site – could fix this problem. Vaccination rates tripled in the villages that were randomly selected to have access to these clinics, at 18 per cent compared to 6 per cent. This increased further, to 39 per cent, if families received a bag of lentils as a bonus when they vaccinated their children. Because the mobile clinic had a high level of fixed costs, the total cost per vaccination actually halved, despite the additional expense of the lentils.\nReference:\nMiguel, E., & Kremer, M. (2004). Worms: identifying impacts on education and health in the presence of treatment externalities. Econometrica, 72(1), 159-217.\n\n\n\n15.0.3.3 Microcredit\nDevelopment economists have also used field experiments to evaluate programmes that have already been implemented on a large scale. One example is the massive introduction of micro-loans in various countries, which has been the source of great optimism. Banerjee, Duflo et al. performed an initial study on a micro-credit programme that focused on poor households in the Indian metropolis of Hyderabad. Their field experiments showed rather small positive effects on investments in existing small businesses, but they found no effects on consumption or other development indicators, neither at 18 nor at 36 months. Similar field experiments, in countries such as Bosnia-Herzegovina, Ethiopia, Morocco, Mexico and Mongolia, have found similar results.\n\nMicrocredit is a type of financial service that provides small loans, often ranging from USD10 to USD2,000 (up to USD50,000 in some developed nations), to individuals with low income, no collateral, or no access to traditional banking services. It is designed to promote self-employment, support small business growth, and alleviate poverty by allowing borrowers to invest in income-generating activities.\nWho Can Get Microcredit?\n\nMicrocredit is primarily targeted at individuals excluded from the traditional banking system. Typical recipients include: - Low-Income Entrepreneurs: People in underdeveloped or developing countries looking to start or expand small businesses. - Women: Women make up the vast majority (roughly 75-95%) of microcredit recipients worldwide, as they are often targeted to foster economic independence and have higher repayment rates. - Unbanked/Underbanked Individuals: People who lack a credit history or formal banking access. - Informal Workers: Small-scale traders, farmers, or artisans. - Rural Residents: Individuals in areas with limited access to bank branches.\nReference: Banerjee, A., Duflo, E., Glennerster, R., & Kinnan, C. (2015). The miracle of microfinance? Evidence from a randomized evaluation. American economic journal: Applied economics, 7(1), 22-53.\n\n\n\n15.0.4 Takeaway\nPoverty persists despite billions spent, partly because well-intentioned aid often lacks proof of real impact. Randomized controlled trials, like those used in medicine, reveal which solutions save lives and boost education. Simple interventions—such as giving lentils to encourage immunization or providing free bed nets—can multiply results at lower cost. Evidence from these experiments now guides smarter policies that move beyond intuition and ideology.\n\nGiving small incentives, like lentils for immunization, can multiply participation rates.\nProviding free bed nets saves more lives and does not undermine future purchases.\nDeworming children delivers huge educational gains for minimal investment.\nRelying on data-driven experiments can replace hope and guesswork in development policies.\n\n\n\n15.0.5 Policy influence\nThe Laureates’ work has had clear effects on policy, both directly and indirectly. Naturally, it is impossible to precisely measure how important their research has been in shaping policies in various countries. However, it is sometimes possible to draw a straight line from research to policy. Some of the studies we have already mentioned have indeed had a direct impact on policy. The studies of remedial tutoring eventually provided arguments for large-scale support programmes that have now reached more than five million Indian children. The deworming studies not only showed that deworming provides clear health benefits for schoolchildren, but also that parents are very price-sensitive. In accordance with these results, the WHO recommends that medicine is distributed for free to the over 800 million schoolchildren living in areas where more than 20 per cent of them have a specific type of parasitic worm infection.",
