    "section": "1.2 Meaning and Purpose of Life",
    "text": "1.2 Meaning and Purpose of Life\n\n1.2.1 What is the meaning of your life?\nHaving a meaning in life is one of the most fundamental human needs. However, for most people, finding their meaning in life is not obvious. Modern life has a way of distracting people from their true goals and many people find it hard to define the meaning in life. Especially at younger ages, people are searching for meaning in life, but this has been found to be unrelated to actually finding meaning (Schippers and Ziegler, 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\nViktor Frankl, an Austrian neurologist and psychiatrist who had survived the holocaust, used his experience to formulate a theory on the meaning of life. He concluded that life can have meaning even in the most impoverished circumstances (Frankl, 2014).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.2 What is the purpose of your life?\nPeople with a purpose in life are less likely to experience conflict when making health-related decisions and are more likely to self-regulate when making these decisions and consequently experience better (mental) health outcomes (Kang et al., 2019).\nHaving a purpose in life can aid in overcoming stress, depression, anxiety, and other psychological problems (Kim et al., 2014; Freedland, 2019).\nPurpose in life has been related to a decrease in mortality across all ages (Hill and Turiano, 2014). It thus appears that many benefits may be gained by enhancing meaning and purpose in life.\nThe best day of your life is the one on which you decide your life is your own. No apologies or excuses. No one to lean on, rely on, or blame. The gift is yours – it is an amazing journey – and you alone are responsible for the quality of it. This is the day your life really begins (- Bob Moawad).",

To improve this situation, the green revolution took place.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4\n\n\nThe Green Revolution was a period of significant agricultural innovation that took place from the 1940s to the 1960s. The revolution involved the development of high-yielding crop varieties, modern farming techniques, and improved infrastructure to support the growth and distribution of crops. The goal of the Green Revolution was to increase agricultural productivity and reduce poverty and hunger.\nOne of the primary reasons for the Green Revolution was the need to address food shortages around the world. As the global population grew, it became increasingly clear that traditional farming methods were not sufficient to meet the growing demand for food. The Green Revolution was seen as a way to increase the amount of food produced without increasing the amount of land used for agriculture.\nThe Green Revolution had a significant impact on food production, particularly in developing countries. Countries such as India, Mexico, and the Philippines were able to significantly increase their food production, which helped to reduce hunger and poverty in those areas.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5\n\n\nHowever, the Green Revolution also had some negative impacts. The increased use of pesticides and fertilizers led to environmental degradation and health problems for farmers and consumers. Additionally, the focus on high-yielding varieties of crops led to a reduction in biodiversity, which could have long-term implications for food security.\nOverall, the Green Revolution was a significant step forward in addressing food shortages and reducing poverty and hunger around the world. However, it also highlights the need for sustainable agriculture practices that balance the need for increased food production with environmental and health concerns.\n\n4.4.1 The first agricultural revolution\nThe first agricultural revolution, also known as the Neolithic revolution, was a significant turning point in human history that occurred approximately 10,000 years ago. This revolution was characterized by the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture and the domestication of plants and animals.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.6\n\n\nDuring the first agricultural revolution, humans learned to cultivate crops such as wheat, barley, and rice, and to domesticate animals such as cows, pigs, and sheep. This allowed them to settle in one place and develop permanent settlements, which eventually led to the development of cities and civilizations.\nThe first agricultural revolution also brought about other important changes, such as the development of tools for farming and the creation of new social structures based on the ownership of land and the division of labor.\nOverall, the first agricultural revolution was a transformation period in human history that laid the foundation for many of the social, economic, and cultural developments that have occurred since then.\n\n\n4.4.2 The second agricultural revolution\nThe second agricultural revolution is a term used to describe a period of agricultural development that occurred between the late 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. It was a time of significant advancements in agricultural techniques and technology, which led to increased productivity and efficiency in farming.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.7\n\n\nSome of the key innovations of the second agricultural revolution include:\n\nMechanization: The use of machines like tractors and plows made farming faster and more efficient.\nChemical fertilizers: Farmers began using synthetic fertilizers to improve soil fertility and crop yields.\nIrrigation: The development of more efficient irrigation systems allowed farmers to grow crops in areas that were previously too dry or arid.\nSelective breeding: Farmers began selectively breeding crops and livestock to create stronger and more productive strains.\nCrop rotation: The practice of rotating crops between different fields to prevent soil depletion and pest infestations.\n\nThese innovations helped to increase food production, which in turn led to population growth and urbanization. The second agricultural revolution also paved the way for the development of modern agribusiness and the use of genetically modified crops.\nOverall, the second agricultural revolution was a significant milestone in the history of agriculture and had a profound impact on the way we grow food today.\n\n\n4.4.3 The third agricultural revolution/ The green revolution\nThe third agricultural revolution, also known as the Green Revolution, refers to a period of significant agricultural advancement that began in the mid-20th century, particularly in the 1960s and 1970s. This period saw a rapid adoption of new technologies and practices in agriculture that aimed to increase productivity and efficiency in farming.\n\n\n\nFigure 7.8\n\n\nThe Green Revolution was primarily focused on developing countries in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where hunger and malnutrition were widespread due to low agricultural productivity. The main goal of the Green Revolution was to increase food production to feed the growing population and to reduce poverty and hunger.\nSome of the key innovations of the Green Revolution include:\n\nHigh-yielding crop varieties: Scientists developed new strains of crops such as wheat, rice, and maize that were more resistant to pests and diseases, had higher yields, and were more responsive to fertilizers.\nIrrigation systems: The development of efficient irrigation systems allowed farmers to grow crops in previously unsuitable areas.\nChemical fertilizers and pesticides: The use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides increased crop yields and protected crops from pests and diseases.\nMechanization: The use of tractors, combines, and other machinery made farming faster and more efficient.\n\nThe Green Revolution helped to increase food production in developing countries, and as a result, reduced hunger and malnutrition. However, there were also some negative consequences, including increased reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, soil degradation, and the displacement of traditional farming practices.\nOverall, the Green Revolution was a significant step forward in the history of agriculture, and its legacy can still be seen in the way we grow food today.\nAssignment:\nPlease check the KUTLMS.",

Although people have been concerned about environmental quality for decades, or even centuries, the widespread societal recognition of the importance of environmental protection is a relatively recent phenomenon.",

In the presence of few people, environment can cleansing itself automatically\n\nIf there were few people in the world, the earth’s environment would be very forgiving and capable of absorbing most of what humans throw at it, cleansing itself automatically. The days of low population on the earth have passed; the total number of people on the planet and particularly the density of people in some parts of the planet magnify the size of environmental insults, overloading the capacity of the earth for self-cleansing.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1(Source: Ordukhani et. al, 2022)\n\n\nB. Environmental issues often take a backseat to other more pressing needs related to survival\n\nIncome is also important, not only because rich people tend to consume more and thus generate more pollution, but also because the environment is often viewed as a luxury good. For the poor who struggle to keep food on the table, environmental issues often take a backseat to other more pressing needs related to survival. As people become wealthier, they turn their attention increasingly to the quality of their living environment, which ultimately is the planet.\n\nC. Challenges to define right amount of pollution\n\nWhat are the typical issues facing most countries of the world with regard to environmental policy? In developed countries, pollution and the preservation of natural environments (e.g., wilderness areas) are major concerns. Pollution problems usually involve two major issues-what is the right amount of pollution and how can we get polluters to control their emissions?\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2(Source: https://climatekids.nasa.gov/air-pollution/)\n\n\n\nDetermining the right amount of pollution is not easy. Pollution is generated as a by-product of producing goods. To determine the costs of pollution control it is necessary to understand the structure of goods production and how costs will differ for different levels of pollution. Determining the right amount of pollution also involves determining damages from pollution. The words “damages from pollution” deceptively suggest that this is a natural science question, such as counting the dead fish on a polluted lake or determining the level of pollution at which people begin to get sick.\nAir pollution in an urban area can cause physical irritation (itchy eyes, running nose), reduced visibility, degraded visibility, decreased lung capacity, increased susceptibility to illness, and of course illness itself. Some of these effects are tangible, others are very intangible.\nEconomics is accustomed to condensing this variety of effects into a single measure the willingness to pay to reduce pollution. If pollution is bad, people are willing to devote some of their resources to eliminating the pollution.\nThe government could tell each polluter how much to emit, but this would be analogous to central planning in the old Soviet Union-we know it works up to a point but has severe problems, particularly when there are many firms and polluters involved.\nSo the “simple” job of fixing the problem of pollution is not so easy at the policy level and can involve hard-to-solve problems, many in the domain of environmental economics.\nThe examples we have used are from developed economies but a very similar analysis could apply to a developing country. Air pollution is a big problem in many cities of the developing world. Water pollution is probably the most severe environmental problem in many developing countries: water contaminated by human waste kills millions of people annually.\n\nD. Challenges to define natural environments\n\nAnother important type of policy question is the preservation of natural environments, broadly defined. This could involve preserving wild and scenic areas from development or protecting animal and plant species from extinction.\nThe point is that environmental protection usually involves the intervention of governments in the economy and it is often difficult to decide on the proper extent and nature of that intervention. Environmental economics as it is applied to real environmental problems can be invaluable in helping make those important decisions.",

    "text": "5.4 Environmental Economics and Economics\n\nEconomics is a well-developed discipline with an extensive body of theory, a paradigm associated with how the economic world works, strong empirical tools, and a number of branches, or fields of study, associated with pieces of the economy.\nThe fundamental building blocks of economics are contained in microeconomics- the theory of the consumer, the theory of the firm, and the theory of market interaction. This forms the basis for nearly all of economics. Related to microeconomics is the branch of statistics applied to economic phenomena— econometrics. Microeconomics permeates all of economics and econometrics permeates all of applied economics.\nBranching out from basic microeconomic theory are the several fundamental fields of economics. These would include macroeconomics (the study of aggregate as opposed to individual phenomena), public finance (the study of goods not provided by the market and the study of taxation), industrial organization (the in depth study of how firms interact with each other and with consumers and organize themselves into industries), and international trade (concerned with how distinct and independent economies interact). Each of these major fields is concerned with major portions of economic activity and each has unique contributions to make to the overall study of economics.\nEnvironmental economics is an applied field, like many other applied fields in economics. Much of environmental economics involves adapting concepts developed in other branches of economics (particularly public finance and industrial organization) and applying them to environmental problems. Some aspects of environmental economics are unique to the field (such as valuation, mentioned above) and have potential use in economics outside of the environmental economics field.\n\nAssignment:\nPlease check the KUTLMS.\nReference: Charles D.

    "text": "6.1 Main categories of environmental problems\nHuman activity is transforming nearly all of Earth’s natural systems. With the human population now exceeding 8 billion people and rapid growth in per capita consumption of goods and services, humanity’s growing ecological footprint is altering the planet’s land cover, rivers and oceans, climate system, biogeochemical cycles, and the functioning of its ecosystems (Foley, J., et. al., 2005).\nPollution is a problem historically\nPollution problems are not new to mankind. It has always been the case that urban areas have bad pollution problems, primarily because of the large concentrations of people. People are associated with emissions as well as being the reason pollution is damaging. What is new is the magnitude of the problem and the fact that the world is no longer infinite compared to the ability of people to pollute.\nPopulation growth and the high standard of living make the pollution problem significant\nThe enormous size of our current world’s population and the high standard of living of portions of the population are responsible for the pressures on the environment. A larger economy generates more pollution, all other things being equal; richer citizens usually demand higher levels of environmental quality. And as long as the world becomes more populated and wealthier, the pressures will only increase. This is not to say environmental problems cannot be solved, only that it will become increasingly difficult to protect the earth’s environment.\nWe focus on four main categories of environmental problems: (A) air pollution, (B) water pollution, (C) toxic emissions, and (D) ecosystem health.",

    "text": "6.1.1 A. Air Pollution:\n\nAir pollution is primarily a by-product of energy consumption. Impurities in fuels lead to emissions of sulfur dioxide and particulate matter. It is a basic fact of chemistry that burning carbon-based fuels leads to emissions of oxidized carbon-carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. Because our atmosphere contains significant amounts of nitrogen in addition to oxygen, burning fuels inevitably leads to emissions of nitrogen oxides.\nTo a large extent, air pollutants are at their worst in urban areas, due to concentrations of people, both as sources of the pollution (directly or indirectly) and as victims of the pollution. Air pollution can lead to health problems, including sickness as well as physical irritation and reduced human performance.\n\n\n\n6.1.2 B. Water Pollution:\n\nWater pollution has traditionally been the result of organic material deposited in waterways or lakes. One particularly difficult water pollution problem is pollution of groundwater. Groundwater, water in underground aquifers, is the source of drinking water for many people. Because of the cleansing ability of the earth above the aquifer, groundwater has traditionally been relatively contaminant free.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3\n\n\n\nSurface waters, such as lakes and rivers, are the ultimate repositories of much that is deposited on the land. Lakes and rivers throughout the developed world suffer to varying degrees from excessive levels of nutrients (from agricultural runoff) and acidification. Nutrients can promote the growth of algae and phytoplankton, which increase the turbidity of the waters.\n\n\n\n6.1.3 C. Toxic Emissions:\n\nToxic chemicals in the environment have been a problem for decades. There are significant discharges of heavy metals and other toxics into the aquatic environment, even in developed countries.\nAnother serious toxic problem from the perspective of human health is lead. During this century, the most significant source of lead poisoning has been through air pollution, due to lead in motor fuels.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.4(Source: www.aqi.in)\n\n\n\nAside from intentional discharges of toxics into the environment, there are two other major sources of toxics-old toxic waste sites and accidental discharges. Toxic wastes do not rapidly decay and become harmless. Some abandoned industrial sites from the nineteenth century are still considered chemically hazardous.\n\n\n\n6.1.4 D. Ecosystem Health:\n\nMost concepts of human health focus on the individual human, whereas ecosystem health treats the entire ecosystem as the unit of policy concern, not the individual animal or plant.\nAn ecosystem can be said to possess integrity when it is wild—that is, free as much as possible from human intervention today, and “unmanaged,” although not necessarily pristine. This aspect of integrity is the most significant one; it is the aspect that differentiates the wild from ecosystem health, which allows support and manipulation.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5(Coral health in St. Thomas: Wikipedia)\n\n\n\nMost of the foregoing environmental problems (air, water, toxics) are sometimes referred to as “brown” issues-associated with pollution, often from industrial sources. Some environmental issues do not directly involve pollution in the conventional sense.\nMany green issues have to do with the health of specific species of animals or plants, or ecosystems, consisting of interconnected species of animals and plants. The rapid rise in the earth’s population has inevitably placed great strain on wild ecosystems around the planet.",

    "text": "6.2 Environmental regulation\nThere is a surprising amount of similarity in how countries around the world have responded to environmental problems. I will discuss about very superficial examination of environmental protection regulation in the European Union, Russia, and the United States.\n\n6.2.1 European Union\n\n\n\nFigure 9.6(Source: www.politics-dz.com)\n\n\n\n6.2.1.1 Regulatory Approach:\n\nEuropean Union policy with regard to the environment is implemented through the issuing of what are known as directives. A directive is an EU “law” that is binding on the governments of member countries, requiring each government to pass its own legislation to implement the directive.\nOne of the most widely noticed directives was the 1988 directive that set forth sulfur emission controls for large electricity-generating stations. The impetus for EU level action was the problem of acid rain and acid deposition, which are pollution problems that do not respect national borders.\nThe directive is very specific as to how much emissions may come from new power plants; in fact, the directive specified the pollution control technology to be used on most new power plants.\n\n\n\n6.2.1.2 The Use of Economic Incentives:\n\nThere is a longer history of the use of economic incentives in the EU than in most other parts of the world.\nOne of the clearest economic incentives in use in the EU is the German Water Pollution charge, instituted in 1976 and implemented in 1981. The charge is established at the federal (national) level. It is left up to the states of Germany to implement and enforce the fee. However, it is unclear how much pollution has been reduced as a result of the fee.\nAnother charge that appears to have some incentive effects is the Dutch charge on the discharge of organic material into sewer systems. The problem was how to pay for the water treatment facilities necessary to improve river water quality. Somewhat logically, the parties using the system were charged a fee, and the fee was based on the load the sources would place on the treatment facility. Thus the legislative motivation appears to be simply revenue raising.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.2 The Russian Federation\n\n6.2.2.1 Regulatory Approach:\n\nMuch of the Russian approach to environmental protection has its origins in the Soviet Union. The 1970s was the beginning of significant Soviet actions to protect the environment. Both water pollution and air pollution controls were instituted in this period, along with the establishment of the country’s basic framework of pollution regulation. The then Soviet and now Russian regulatory approach relies on health-based ambient standards for a wide variety of pollutants.\nOne of the major differences between environmental regulation in Russia and the rest of the world is the use of the “environmental fund,” though in recent years it has been absorbed into the general budget. The environmental fund is a major financial resource to be used to help clean up the environment and finance pollution control measures. Funds (pots of money) are associated with each level of environmental regulation-federal, regional, and local.\n\n\n\n6.2.2.2 The Use of Economic Incentives:\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Russia makes extensive use of emission fees (as do many other countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union). In the late 1980s the Soviet Union was experimenting with emission fees and these were embraced by Russia in the early 1990s. The original intent of the emission fee was to finance the environmental funds. If the environmental funds were in turn to pay for environmental protection, it seemed logical that polluters should contribute to the fund based on their emission levels.\nSeveral studies of the emission fee system report that the fee levels are too low to provide much of an incentive for pollution control. Despite these findings, the fee system will be important to monitor as Russia’s market economy evolves in the coming years.\n\n\n\n\n6.2.3 United States of America\n\n6.2.3.1 Regulatory Approach:\n\nThe United States is a federal system with some powers vested and exercised at the national level and some powers residing at the level of the state. Although environmental protection legislation dates to the nineteenth century or before (as in many countries), substantive and major national environmental legislation was first passed in the 1960s.\nThe post-World War II period saw rapid growth in the U.S. economy, along with increasing stress on the environment, increased per-capita income, and thus increased demand for environmental quality.\nCalifornia took action in the early 1960s to establish emission standards for automobiles. This was quickly followed by national legislation requiring manufacturers to install certain antipollution devices on new cars and, eventually, to meet ever-tightening limits on emissions of particular pollutants per mile traveled.\n\n\n\n6.2.3.2 The Use of Economic Incentives:\n\nIn 1990 a new market in sulfur emissions was established by legislation in an attempt to reduce sulfur emissions that lead to acid deposition (acid rain). At the time of the legislation, approximately 20 million tons of sulfur dioxide were emitted annually in the United States. The goal was to cut that in half. To accomplish that goal, a system of marketable emission permits was set up, phased in over a decade. This was the first major experiment in economic incentives in the United States.\nOne obvious type of economic incentive is the widespread adoption of volume-based pricing for municipal solid waste. It is now very common for households to pay by the “bag” for disposal services.\nThere have been a number of other emission trading schemes in the United States, most prominently the offset system whereby new polluters entering a heavily polluted area may pay existing polluters to reduce emissions.\n\nAssignment:\nPlease check the KUTLMS.\nReferences:\n\nFoley, J.

In turn, these concerns are playing a growing role in domestic politics. environmental issues are playing a growing role in disputes about international trade as well. Some anti-globalization activists claim that growing international trade automatically harms the environment; some also claim that international trade agreements—and the role of the World Trade Organization in particular—have the effect of blocking environmental action.\nMost international economists view the first claim as simplistic and disagree with the second. That is, they deny that there is a simple relationship between globalization and environmental damage and do not believe that trade agreements prevent countries from having enlightened environmental policies.

    "text": "7.1.1 The inverted U-shaped EKC\n\nEmpirical evidence suggests that as economies grow, they initially do increasing environmental damage–but they become more environmentally friendly once they become sufficiently rich. China, where the environment is deteriorating as the economy expands, is in effect moving from A to B. Richer countries may be moving from C to D, using some of their growth to improve the environment.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Environmental Kuznet Curve\n\n\n\nIn the early 1990s, Princeton economists Gene Grossman and Alan Krueger, studying the relationship between national income levels and pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, found that these offsetting effects of economic growth lead to a distinctive “inverted U” relationship between per-capita income and environmental damage known as the environmental Kuznets curve. This concept, whose relevance has been confirmed by a great deal of further research, is illustrated schematically in Figure 9a.\nThe idea is that as a country’s income per-capita rises due to economic growth, the initial effect is growing damage to the environment. Thus, China, whose economy has surged in recent decades, is in effect moving from point A to point B: As the country burns more coal in its power plants and produces more goods in its factories, it emits more sulfur dioxide into the air and dumps more effluent into its rivers.\nBut when a country gets sufficiently rich, it can afford to take action to protect the environment. As the United States has grown richer in recent decades, it has also moved to limit pollution. For example, cars are required to have catalytic converters that reduce smog, and a government-licensing scheme limits emissions of sulfur dioxide from power plants. In terms of Figure 9a, the United States has on some fronts, such as local air pollution, moved from C to D: growing richer and doing less damage to the environment. Figure 9b shows different stages of EKC.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Different stages in EKC\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2 The N-shaped EKC\n\nScholars supporting N-shaped EKC have proposed a different theory. They believed that even at a higher stage of economic development if innovation cannot keep up with the speed of economic growth and the increase in technological effects is slower than the scale effect, environmental pollution may reappear (Lorente and Álvarez-Herranz, 2016).\nIn other words, the shape of the EKC may extend from an inverted U-shape to an N-shape. This N-shaped model assumes that economic growth leads to environmental degradation that reverses with economic progress after reaching a positive peak and that pollution levels approach a negative peak before starting to rise again with further economic progress.\nCompared with the inverted U-shaped EKC, the most critical gap lies in the rebound of environmental pollution in the third stage. Scholars refer to this pattern as the technological obsolescence effect, representing the re-emergence of scale effects and overcoming the compositional and technological effects that preceded the second turning point (Lorente and Álvarez-Herranz, 2016; Balsalobre-Lorente et al., 2018).\nThe emergence of this phenomenon is believed to be related to neglected environmental regulations and slow technological innovation.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: N-shaped EKC",

    "text": "7.2 What does Kuznet Curve have to do with international trade?\n\nTrade liberalization is often advocated on the grounds that it will promote economic growth. To the extent that it succeeds in accomplishing this end, it will raise per-capita income. Will this improve or worsen environmental quality? It depends which side of the environmental Kuznets curve an economy is on. In their original paper, which was in part a response to critics of the North American Free Trade Agreement who argued that the agreement would be environmentally harmful, Grossman and Krueger suggested that Mexico might be on the right side of the curve—that is, to the extent that NAFTA raises Mexican income, it might actually lead to a reduction in environmental damage.\nHowever, the environmental Kuznets curve does not, by any means, necessarily imply that globalization is good for the environment. In fact, it’s fairly easy to make the argument that at a world level, globalization has indeed harmed the environment—at least so far.\nThis argument would run as follows: The biggest single beneficiary of globalization has arguably been China, whose export-led economy has experienced incredible growth since 1980. Meanwhile, the single biggest environmental issue is surely climate change: There is broad scientific consensus that emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are leading to a rise in the Earth’s average temperature.\nChina’s boom has been associated with a huge increase in its emissions of carbon dioxide. Figure 9c shows carbon dioxide emissions of the United States, Europe, and China from 1980 to 2011. In 1980, China was a minor factor in global warming; by 2008, it was, by a substantial margin, the world’s leading emitter of greenhouse gases. It’s important to realize, though, that the problem here isn’t globalization per se—it’s China’s economic success, which has to some extent come as a result of globalization. And despite environmental concerns, it’s difficult to argue that China’s growth, which has raised hundreds of millions of people out of dire poverty, is a bad thing.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Carbon Dioxide Emissions (The rapid economic growth of China has turned it from a minor factor in climate change to the world’s largest emitter of carbon dioxide.)",

    "text": "7.3 The Problem of “Pollution Havens”\nWhen ships get too old to continue operating, they are disassembled to recover their scrap metal and other materials. One way to look at “shipbreaking” is that it is a form of recycling: Instead of leaving a ship to rust, a shipbreaking firm extracts and reuses its components. Ultimately, this salvaging means that less iron ore needs to be mined, less oil extracted, and so on. One might expect shipbreaking to be good for the environment. The task itself, however, can be environmentally hazardous: Everything from the residual oil in a ship’s tanks to the plastic in its chairs and interior fittings, if not handled carefully, can be toxic to the local environment.\nPollution is the classic example of a negative externality—a cost that individuals impose on others but don’t pay for. That’s why pollution is a valid reason for government intervention. However, different forms of pollution have very different geographical reach—and only those that extend across national boundaries obviously justify international concern.\nThus, to the extent that Indian ship breaking pollutes the local environment. this is a problem for India; it’s less clear that it is a problem for other countries. Similarly, air pollution in Mexico City is a problem for Mexico; it’s not clear why it’s a valid U.S. interest. On the other hand, emissions of carbon dioxide affect the future climate for all countries: They’re an international externality and deserve to be the subject of international negotiation.\nAssignment:\nPlease check the KUTLMS.\nReferences:\n\nPaul Krugman, Maurice Obstfeld, and Marc Melitz, International Trade: Theory and Policy, 11th edition.",

    "text": "Why are many roads so annoyingly congested? Why are many fisheries threatened by over fishing? About a half century ago, a biologist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, warned of the “Tragedy of the Commons”’ and popularized concern with open access resources.\nThe tragedy, simply stated, is that when there are no owners of resources (such as the oceans or common grazing grounds) or if the owners are public entities which exert no control over use (such as open roads), then there is a real risk that the resources will be overused.\nSuch resources are termed open access (anyone may access them), common property (everyone owns the property and has access), or common pool (everyone is drawing from a common pool). We will use the three terms interchangeably.\nA simple example of the problem of open access is the divided highway/road (free way/motorway/autobahn), at least in cases where access is not regulated (i.e., when motorists can freely enter and leave the road). In many urban areas, these roads become highly congested, particularly at certain times of the day, and traffic may slow from a normal speed of 80 kph to much lower levels (e.g., 20 kph) or even come to a dead stop. Why does this occur? And what can be done about it?\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Public goods (Source: www.marketbusinessnews.com)\n\n\n\nAnother example comes from urban air pollution, particularly in years prior to serious regulatory attention to the problem, which began in the mid-20th century. The air shed had been open access for polluters. Factories and automobiles alike treated the urban air shed as common property-everyone’s property for waste disposal but nobody’s property in terms of regulating use. The result was over use of the air shed-excessive pollution. What options are open to fix this?\nThe decimation of the American passenger pigeon is a sad example of an open access resource resulting in extinction of a species. The pigeon stock was open access and a tasty morsel for the settlers in 19th century America. The pigeon is now extinct due to over harvesting. Why did this occur and what could have been done to prevent it?\n\n\n\n\nFigure: American passenger pigeon (Source: https://birds.fandom.com/wiki/Passenger_Pigeon)",

In a classic example of externalities, the owner of an apple orchard provides a positive externality for a neighboring apiary (in terms of the quantity and sweetness of the honey). And the apiary provides a positive externality to the orchard in terms of the bees pollinating the apple blossoms.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Honey Bee\n\n\n\nDEFINITION: An externality exists when the consumption or production choices of one person or firm enters the utility or production function of another entity without that entity’s permission or compensation.",

    "text": "8.3 Public goods and bads\n\nEconomics has defined two fundamental characteristics of goods: excludability and rivalry. Excludability has to do with whether it is possible to use prices to ration individual use of the good. Rivalry has to do with whether it is desirable to ration individual use, through prices or any other means.\n\n\n8.3.1 Excludability\n\nTo be able to use prices to allocate a good, it is necessary to ensure that consumers do not consume a good unless an appropriate price has been paid. Thus ti must be possible to keep the consumer from the good. This is excludability. Not all goods are excludable.\nAn example is the fishery on the high seas. Keeping consumers (in this case fishers) from using this resource is very difficult (i.e., costly). As an example of a bad, air pollution is also nonexcludable. Air, of whatever level of cleanliness, is all around us. We cannot exclude certain people from consuming air pollution.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Fishery on the high seas\n\n\n\nDEFINITION A good is excludable if it is feasible and practical to selectively allow consumers to consume the good. A bad is excludable if it is feasible and practical to selectively allow consumers to avoid consumption of the bad.\n\n\nWhy is excludability important? Because to attach a price to the consumption of a good or bad, we have to be able to deny that consumption if the price is not paid. This is how market allocation works. For a good, this is a straightforward concept. If I produce hamburgers, I must be able to deny you the right to consume a hamburger unless you pay for it.\nAnother example of a nonexcludable good would be a city park without a fence and entrance control. I cannot charge for admission because anyone can use the park, whether or not they have paid admission. Thus no one will pay admission. A fence and entrance control could be added, but this would be so expensive that its cost could outweigh any benefits associated with restricting entry to the park.\nGenerally, we would expect to see exclusion only when the benefits of exclusion outweigh the costs of exclusion. Exclusion must be not only technologically possible but also not too costly, relative to the benefits of exclusion (if any). This is the reason the word “practical” is used in the definition of exclusion.\nFor a bad, the concept is a little more subtle. Household garbage is excludable with the right laws on littering and trespass; it is not excludable without those laws. Suppose I have generated some household trash and wish to pay someone to consume it (i.e., store it safely). Without laws on trash disposal, whom- ever I pay to dispose of my garbage could simply leave ti by the side of the road or throw it back into my yard. With laws preventing such actions, when I pay someone to consume my trash, that person must retain control of the trash until someone else voluntarily (i.e., with pay) agrees to take it.\n\n\n8.3.1.1 Two factors play major role in excludability\n\nOne is the cost of exclusion\nThe other is the technology of exclusion and how it changes over time\nFor instance, a case applies to television, particularly those programs disseminated via satellite and cable. Historically, it has been too expensive to exclude consumers. However, with the development of low-cost signal scramblers and unscramblers, exclusion became economically feasible, particularly for high value programs such as recent films.\nEnvironmental goods have undergone some change in excludability over the past few decades, mostly through legal rather than technological changes. The simplest example is garbage (like the normal household type). Without institutions, garbage is not excludable. Without laws against littering, garbage will simply be dumped wherever convenient, much as it was in the Middle Ages in Europe when people would throw it out their window onto the street. This, however, has been defined as littering or creating a nuisance and is illegal in most locales. Consequently, garbage is now excludable. People can selectively choose to trade money and garbage. This is the economic transaction of the trash collector and the household. This legal aspect of excludability of course could also apply to ordinary goods. Without laws protecting property and outlawing stealing, all goods would be open access and exclusion would not be possible.\nWhy is excludability important? For a price system to work it must be possible to take possession of the good or bad for which the price is being paid. Without excludability, a price system cannot work.\n\n\n\n\n8.3.2 Rivalry\n\nA second important characteristic of goods is rivalry. This is a slightly more subtle concept than excludability. Rivalry pertains to the manner in which a good is consumed. As an example, compare the consumption of a bratwurst with that of a flower garden.\nFor the bratwurst, the act of consumption destroys the good and makes it unavailable for anyone else to consume. In contrast, the act of consumption of a flower garden involves light bouncing of flowers and being transmitted to the eyes of the consumer. This is fundamentally nondestructive to the flower garden and in no way diminishes the ability of someone else to “consume” the flower garden in precisely the same way.\n\nExamples of goods and bads:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRival\nNonrival\n\n\n\n\nExcludable\nPrivate goods\nGoods: Burger\nBads: Household garbage today\nClub goods\nGoods: Local public beach with access control\nBads: Water pollution in small lake\n\n\nNonexcludable\nOpen access resources\nGoods: Fishery\nBads: Household garbage in Middle Ages\nPure public goods\nGoods: National defense or\nglobal climate\nBads: Greenhouse gases\n\n\n\nAssignment:\nPlease check the KUTLMS.\nReferences:\n\nCharles D.

Humans play a major role in the carbon cycle through activities such as the burning of fossil fuels or land development.\n\n\n\nFigure: Global Carbon Cycle (Source: https://airs.jpl.nasa.gov/resources/155/global-carbon-cycle/)\n\n\nOver the past centuries, fossil fuels have played an essential role in the unprecedented development of the human civilization, but rapid fossil fuels combustion since the industrial revolution results in over 35 gigatonnes CO2 emission annually, which gradually disrupts the balance of the natural carbon cycle and causes serve climate issues including but not limited to the climate change, rising sea-levels, and decreasing food security.\n\n\n9.1.2 Blue carbon:\nBlue carbon is the term for carbon captured by the world’s ocean and coastal ecosystems. Sea grasses, mangroves, salt marshes, and other systems along our coast are very efficient in storing \\(CO_2\\). These areas also absorb and store carbon at a much faster rate than other areas, such as forests, and can continue to do so for millions of years.\n\n\n\nFigure: Blue carbon (Source: www.oceanservice.noaa.gov)\n\n\n\n\n9.1.3 Effects of Changing the Carbon Cycle\n\nAll of this extra carbon needs to go somewhere. So far, land plants and the ocean have taken up about 55 percent of the extra carbon people have put into the atmosphere while about 45 percent has stayed in the atmosphere. Eventually, the land and oceans will take up most of the extra carbon dioxide, but as much as 20 percent may remain in the atmosphere for many thousands of years.\nThe changes in the carbon cycle impact each reservoir. Excess carbon in the atmosphere warms the planet. Excess carbon in the ocean makes the water more acidic, putting marine life in danger.\nHumans play a major role in the carbon cycle through activities such as the burning of fossil fuels or land development. As a result, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rapidly rising; it is already considerably greater than at any time in the last 3.6 million years.\n\n\n\n9.1.4 Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\nGHG emissions accounting is an important factor in the design and implementation of climate mitigation policy.

Nitrogen is a key component of the bodies of living organisms. Nitrogen doesn’t remain forever in the bodies of living organisms. Instead, it’s converted from organic nitrogen back into \\(N_2\\) gas by bacteria.\nHaving nitrogen around and being able to make use of it are two different things. We humans may not be able to fix nitrogen biologically, but we certainly do industrially! About 450 million metric tons of fixed nitrogen are made each year using a chemical method called the Haber-Bosch process, in which \\(N_2\\) is reacted with hydrogen (\\(H_2\\)) at high temperatures. Most of this fixed nitrogen goes to make fertilizers we use on our lawns, gardens, and agricultural fields.\nIn general, human activity releases nitrogen into the environment by two main means: combustion of fossil fuels and use of nitrogen-containing fertilizers in agriculture. Both processes increase levels of nitrogen-containing compounds in the atmosphere.\n\n\n9.2.1 Nitrogen cycle\nThe nitrogen cycle refers to the movement of nitrogen within and between the atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and geosphere.

Economists today include human capital as a category of capital goods because they have discovered ways to measure its value – not only to the individuals who acquire it, but also to society at large.\n\n\n\n10.1.3 Natural capital\n\nIn the past decades, economists have developed methods for measuring the value individuals place on natural resources; so we now have a third category of capital goods: natural capital. The methods can be involved, for natural capital ranges over plants (they are tangible and alienable), pollinators (they are tangible and often non-alienable), the view from one’s sea-front home (it is intangible and alienable) and the global climate (it is intangible and non-alienable).\nValuation methods that involve estimating the use value of Nature by determining the productivity of its processes involve a blend of ecological and economic reasoning: The accounting value of a lake fishery can be approximated by the market value of catch over time.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Interaction Between the Capitals",

    "text": "11.2 Greenhouse gases and climate change\n\nGlobal climate change negotiations are driven by concerns about the process of global warming, which is likely to result from an increased accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere. The most significant greenhouse gas, in quantitative terms, is carbon dioxide, which contributes about two-thirds of the total global warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions. Human activity leads to carbon dioxide emissions principally through the combustion of fossil fuels – the use of coal, oil, and gas in industrial processes, to generate electricity, as motor fuels, and for domestic heating.\nIn addition to carbon dioxide, the other significant greenhouse gases include methane, nitrous oxide, and CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons, chemicals used as aerosol propellants, refrigerants, and in various industrial processes). Per tonne emitted, these gases vary widely in the harm they do. Each tonne of methane emissions has an impact on global warming equivalent to 23 tonnes of carbon dioxide, while some CFCs have a global warming potential equivalent to a thousand tonnes or more of carbon dioxide.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: GHG effect\n\n\n\nLevels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have been rising steadily ever since the Industrial Revolution. In 1850, the atmosphere contained some 290 parts per million by volume (ppmv) of greenhouse gases, and this has now risen to 430 ppmv, and is increasing at some 2.3 ppmv annually. Over the course of the 20th century, the Earth warmed by about 0.7 degrees Celsius. The rate of warming appears to be accelerating, with a temperature rise of 0.2°C in each of the last three decades.\nForecasting the growth of emissions and the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere needs to take account of future economic growth – including the very rapid industrialization of China, India, and other developing countries – and the development of energy technologies. The Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change summarized the available evidence and estimates. It suggested that future growth in emissions could lead to an atmospheric concentration of 550 ppmv by 2050, and that the annual rate of increase in concentration would by then have reached 4.5 ppmv, and would still be increasing. By the end of the century, atmospheric concentrations could exceed 850 ppmv, more than three times pre-industrial levels.\nAlthough people often talk about ‘global warming’ and ‘climate change’ interchangeably, climate scientists and policy-makers are increasingly conscious that the issues are not simply limited to a general rise in global temperatures. Some of the most important issues concern the uneven geographical distribution of climate changes, and the likely increase in climate instability. While global temperatures may rise on average, some areas may become very much warmer, while others may experience less rise in temperature. Effects on the pattern of rainfall may be large and uneven, with possibly drastic effects on the viability of agriculture in some areas. Above all, there is now a recognition that global climate change may involve increased instability in climate patterns, and increased frequency and severity of extreme events – hurricanes, floods, forest fires, and the like.",

The problem is generated by an accumulation of emissions rather than the level of emissions in any one year, it is surrounded by substantial uncertainty about the scale and pattern of effects, there is a possibility of catastrophic and/or irreversible effects, and many of the effects of current emissions and policy measures will be experienced in the distant future.\nThe physical process of global warming is a dynamic process, developing over a long time scale, in which damage is done as a result of the stock of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases accumulated in the atmosphere, rather than the annual emissions flow. The stock is, of course, the result of past and current emissions. Each year’s emissions add a further increment to the stock, in other words to the concentration of greenhouse gases in the global atmosphere. This means, of course, that halting or reversing global climate change will be extremely difficult. Cutting the level of annual greenhouse gas emissions from now on, even quite sharply, may still not prevent increases in the stock of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, albeit at a slower rate than without any emissions cuts.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Dynamic process of global warming (Source: IPCC)",

Per unit of energy, coal is taxed more heavily than oil and natural gas, while non-fossil-fuel sources of energy are untaxed. Burning fuel containing a given quantity of carbon leads predictably and unavoidably to a given amount of carbon dioxide emissions, so that a tax on the carbon content of fuels is almost equivalent to taxing carbon dioxide emissions themselves. With the exception of carbon-capture-and-storage technologies that may shortly become available for power stations no viable end-of-pipe cleaning technologies for carbon dioxide emissions are currently available.\nTaxing carbon would encourage energy users to substitute away from high-carbon energy sources towards fuels with lower emissions per unit of energy. If levied on the fuels used by power stations, for example, a carbon tax would encourage a shift away from power generation using coal towards oil and gas, and even more strongly towards untaxed renewables (wind and wave power), and towards nuclear energy.\n\n\n\n\nFigure: Carbon tax\n\n\n\nSuppose that a carbon tax T is added into the price.

Emissions contribute equally to damage regardless of their source: a tonne of carbon dioxide emitted from the US or Europe is no more or less damaging than a tonne emitted from China or India. Likewise, the damage experienced by any country is a function of global emissions. Individual countries’ emissions or abatement affect the level of climate change damage they experience only through their impact on the concentration of greenhouse gases in the global atmosphere. The global nature of the problem calls for corresponding global action if the risk of catastrophic climate change is to be tackled effectively.\nIdeally, the international agreement needs to encompass all countries, since this would spread the burden of carbon abatement costs most widely, and hence reduce the costs that each country needs to bear. However, getting countries to sign up to an agreement is made difficult by the temptation of free-riding. For any country, staying outside an international agreement on climate change offers the prospect of benefits without costs. A nonsignatory avoids incurring any abatement costs, but would still experience all of the benefits from greenhouse gas abatement measures undertaken by those countries that do sign up to the agreement.\nThe obstacles to reaching a successful climate change agreement are real and substantial: both the temptation of free-riding and disagreement about burden-sharing pose major challenges. Despite the large measure of scientific agreement about the growing risks of climate change – as reflected in the increasingly urgent tone of the reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change – the 2009 summit in Copenhagen which was intended to agree a successor to the Kyoto Protocol failed to reach any meaningful deal on coordinated action. Environmental economics cannot sidestep the negotiating realities – any more than the extensive scientific evidence has done. But it can provide evidence that the scientific case for action is matched by a convincing economic case that the long-run benefits of action will be greater than the costs of carbon abatement. Equally importantly, it has helped to show how policy instruments such as emissions trading and taxation can provide the market signals that will be needed to steer the global economy towards a low-carbon future.\n\nAssignment:\nPlease check the KUTLMS.",

Included would be commodities such as air quality and water quality. Also included would be amenity values such as a beautiful vista over land or ocean or, negatively characterized, a smoggy vista over a city. Even more distant from the conventional notion of a good might be the existence of a species.\nNo matter how esoteric or intangible the environmental good might be, its protection usually requires money. And it is usually appropriate to inquire how much people are willing to contribute to protect that environmental good. Eliciting true values is not easy; but that does not diminish the validity of the principle of demand for environmental goods and services.\nThe challenge to economists is to be comprehensive, viewing all aspects of the environment, over which people have preferences, within the paradigm of consumer theory. The environment is a very complex place. In understanding the value of the environment, it helps to use a classification scheme.\nFrom: Bateman,I.J. (1999) Environmental impact assessment, cost-benefit analysis and the valuation of environmental impacts, in Petts, J. (ed.) Handbook of Environmental Impact Assessment, Vol.1, Blackwell Science, Oxford, pp. 93–120.\nUse value is the conventional notion of value associated with the consumption of a good. In the case of an environmental good, this could include current use (“I am currently visiting the park”), expected use (“I plan to visit the park later this year”), and possible use (“I might visit the park within the next 10 years”).\nThere are several primary avenues whereby environmental goods impact humans.",

Nonuse value is again in a person’s utility without the person actually applying the good, applying the word “using” very broadly. For instance, I may value a blue whale being able to swim freely in the open ocean, despite the fact that I have no intention of ever seeing a blue whale swim in the open ocean.\nThe three basic types of nonuse value are existence value, altruistic value, and bequest value.\n\n12.2.1 Existence value\nExistence value is the value a consumer attaches to knowing something exists (e.g., the African elephant example mentioned earlier). This would be in addition to any value associated with actual or potential “use”.\n\n\n12.2.2 Altruistic value\nAltruistic value derives not from my own consumption but from the fact that I derive benefit when someone else gains utility. So when my neighbor benefits from my cleaning my front yard, if I am altruistic, I obtain utility from the fact that my neighbor is better-off.\n\n\n12.2.3 Bequest value\nBequest value is similar, though associated with the well-being of descendants. If I value passing a wilderness area on to the next generation, that wilderness has a bequest value to me, even if I never use it or intend to use it.\nThe purpose of dissecting value and placing it into these various categories is to understand the complexity whereby environmental goods confer value on consumers. Simply looking at the use value of an environmental asset may obscure much of the value. In fact some environmental assets have little use value but very significant nonuse value.",

    "text": "12.3 Measuring demand\nBecause of the absence of markets for environmental goods, measuring demand is not straightforward. There are two basic approaches to measuring demand: revealed preference and stated preference.\n\n12.3.1 Revealed preference\nIn revealed preference, we observe areal choice ii some market and cleverly infer information on the trade-off between money and the environmental good. For instance, we may notice that two communities are identical except that one has high housing prices and clean air and the other has lower housing prices and dirty air. We may infer that the difference in housing prices reflects the value people place on clean air.\nWithin the category of revealed preference, there are two basic approaches to measuring demand, hedonics and household production.\n\n12.3.1.1 Hedonic approach\nIn the hedonic approach, the goal is to see how the price of a conventional good (e.g., a house) varies as the amount of a closely related environmental good changes (eg., the air quality in the vicinity of the house). This relationship is then used to infer value.\n\n\n12.3.1.2 Household production approach\nThe household production approach starts with the assumption that consumers will combine private goods with the environmental good to “produce” another good, which is the real source of utility.\n\n\n\n12.3.2 Stated preferences\nThe second approach, stated preferences, basically involves asking people how they would trade of money for the environmental good if they had the opportunity to do so. Opinion pols and surveys are used to derive this information. This approach is controversial because of the absence of real choices; only real choices involve actual trades between money and environmental goods. Hypothetical choices lack a realism that may be necessary to obtain accurate information.\n\n12.3.2.1 Contingent valuation\nIn the arena of stated preferences, the dominant approach is termed contingent valuation. Contingent valuation relies on direct revelation of demand from consumers. The name literally means “value contingent no there being a market”—if there were a market, how much would you pay for the environmental good? These values are obtained by directly questioning a sample of potential consumers of the environmental good.\n\n12.3.2.1.1 Demand curve for a market priced good\n\n\n\nFigure: Demand curve for a market priced good (bottled mineral water)\n\n\n\n\n12.3.2.1.2 Demand curve for an unpriced public good\n\n\n\nFigure: Demand curve for an unpriced public good (walks in a wood)\n\n\nAssignment:\nPlease check the KUTLMS.",

    "text": "Preface\nWhat types of social systems are necessary if we are to leave future generations sustainable natural environments and sustainable societies? Why do we keep changing the future Earth’s environment and taking away resources from future generations? Following the Industrial Revolution various innovations took place and we began using massive amounts of fossil fuel. Despite being the cause of the various future failures, this has built a society that blindly focuses on economic growth.\nAn ideal society seeks to balance the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Through “future design”, we can foster harmony between human activities and the natural environment, promote social equity, and ensure economic prosperity in a way that is regenerative and resilient.\nThis course aims to explore the intersection of “future design” and “sustainable development”, delving into various topics, methodologies, and case studies that exemplify these principles in action. From sustainable architecture and urban planning to circular economy practices, renewable energy solutions, and socially responsible design, we will embark on a journey that challenges conventional thinking and empowers us to envision and create a more sustainable future.\nThis course also acknowledges the inherent complexity and multifaceted nature of the challenges we face. It recognizes that achieving sustainability requires a collaborative and interdisciplinary approach, involving experts from diverse fields, as well as active engagement from communities, businesses, and policymakers. By embracing this shared responsibility, we can forge a collective vision and work towards a common goal.\nThis course will consider the existence of Future design in an intersection of Experimental Economics, Environmental Economics and Public Policy.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2021 Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences was awarded to Prof David Card (UC Berkeley), Prof Joshua D. Angrist (MIT), and Prof Guido W. Imbens (Stanford) for pioneering “natural experiments” to help answer important real-world questions. They have provided us with new insights about the labour market and shown what conclusions about cause and effect can be drawn from natural experiments. Their approach has spread to other fields and revolutionised empirical research.\nIf we are to make good decisions, we must understand the consequences of our choices. This applies to individuals as well as public policy makers: young people who are making educational choices want to know how these affect their future income; politicians considering a range of reforms want to know how these affect employment and income distribution, for example. However, answering broad questions about cause and effect is not easy, because we will never know what would have happened if we had made a different choice.\nAssignment:\nPlease check the KUTLMS.\nReferences:\n\nNobel Prize Lecture, David Card, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens, 2021",
